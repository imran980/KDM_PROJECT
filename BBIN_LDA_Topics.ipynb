The winged fairies of Grimm\\r\\nand Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other\\r\\nhuman creations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed\\r\\nas “historical” in the children’s library; for the time has\\r\\ncome for a series of newer “wonder tales” in which the stereotyped\\r\\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and\\r\\nblood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to\\r\\neach tale. Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks\\r\\nonly entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all\\r\\ndisagreeable incident.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of “The Wonderful Wizard of\\r\\nOz” was written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a\\r\\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the\\r\\nheartaches and nightmares are left out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nL. Frank Baum\\r\\nChicago, April, 1900.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\n\\n\\nChapter I\\r\\nThe Cyclone\\n\\r\\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who\\r\\nwas a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their house was\\r\\nsmall, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. There\\r\\nwere four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room\\r\\ncontained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three\\r\\nor four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in one\\r\\ncorner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all,\\r\\nand no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone\\r\\ncellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose,\\r\\nmighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door\\r\\nin the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\\r\\nhole.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but\\r\\nthe great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad\\r\\nsweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.\\r\\nThe sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running\\r\\nthrough it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of\\r\\nthe long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once\\r\\nthe house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains\\r\\nwashed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and wind\\r\\nhad changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a\\r\\nsober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were gray\\r\\nalso. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was an\\r\\norphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child’s\\r\\nlaughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever\\r\\nDorothy’s merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at the\\r\\nlittle girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did not\\r\\nknow what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots,\\r\\nand he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as her\\r\\nother surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with long\\r\\nsilky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his\\r\\nfunny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, and\\r\\nloved him dearly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nToday, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep and\\r\\nlooked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood in\\r\\nthe door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washing\\r\\nthe dishes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry and\\r\\nDorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm.\\r\\nThere now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turned\\r\\ntheir eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction\\r\\nalso.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife.\\r\\n“I’ll go look after the stock.” Then he ran toward the sheds\\r\\nwhere the cows and horses were kept.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of the\\r\\ndanger close at hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed. “Run for the cellar!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nToto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\\r\\nstarted to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in the\\r\\nfloor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caught\\r\\nToto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across the\\r\\nroom there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard that\\r\\nshe lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen a strange thing happened.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air.\\r\\nDorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exact\\r\\ncenter of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still,\\r\\nbut the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up\\r\\nhigher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there it\\r\\nremained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a\\r\\nfeather.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy found\\r\\nshe was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one other\\r\\ntime when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently,\\r\\nlike a baby in a cradle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nToto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barking\\r\\nloudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would\\r\\nhappen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOnce Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the little\\r\\ngirl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking up\\r\\nthrough the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that\\r\\nhe could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and dragged\\r\\nhim into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no more\\r\\naccidents could happen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but she\\r\\nfelt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she\\r\\nnearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces\\r\\nwhen the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terrible\\r\\nhappened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the\\r\\nfuture would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, and\\r\\nlay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soon\\r\\nclosed her eyes and fell fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II\\r\\nThe Council with the Munchkins\\n\\r\\nShe was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not been\\r\\nlying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made her\\r\\ncatch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold little\\r\\nnose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that the\\r\\nhouse was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at the\\r\\nwindow, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at her\\r\\nheels ran and opened the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growing\\r\\nbigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in the\\r\\nmidst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greensward\\r\\nall about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks of\\r\\ngorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumage\\r\\nsang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook,\\r\\nrushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice very\\r\\ngrateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, she\\r\\nnoticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen.\\r\\nThey were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neither\\r\\nwere they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was a\\r\\nwell-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, many\\r\\nyears older.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore round\\r\\nhats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bells\\r\\naround the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men were\\r\\nblue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she wore a white gown that\\r\\nhung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars that\\r\\nglistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the same\\r\\nshade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at\\r\\nthe tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two\\r\\nof them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\\r\\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\\r\\nstiffly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\\r\\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to come\\r\\nfarther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow and\\r\\nsaid, in a sweet voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. We\\r\\nare so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and for\\r\\nsetting our people free from bondage.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little woman\\r\\npossibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the Wicked\\r\\nWitch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had been\\r\\ncarried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything in\\r\\nall her life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, with\\r\\nhesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I have\\r\\nnot killed anything.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with a\\r\\nlaugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointing\\r\\nto the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking out\\r\\nfrom under a block of wood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under the\\r\\ncorner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shod\\r\\nin silver shoes with pointed toes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\\r\\ndismay. “The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But who was she?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered the\\r\\nlittle woman. “She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\\r\\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and are\\r\\ngrateful to you for the favor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\\r\\nWitch ruled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\\r\\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\\r\\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy. “Are you a real witch?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman. “But I am a good\\r\\nwitch, and the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\\r\\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who was\\r\\nhalf frightened at facing a real witch. “Oh, no, that is a great mistake.\\r\\nThere were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those who\\r\\nlive in the North and the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for I\\r\\nam one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East and\\r\\nthe West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one of\\r\\nthem, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one who\\r\\nlives in the West.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Em\\r\\nhas told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and her\\r\\neyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, “I do not know where\\r\\nKansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me,\\r\\nis it a civilized country?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe there\\r\\nare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see,\\r\\nthe Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest\\r\\nof the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking her\\r\\nvoice to a whisper. “He is more powerful than all the rest of us\\r\\ntogether. He lives in the City of Emeralds.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who had\\r\\nbeen standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of the\\r\\nhouse where the Wicked Witch had been lying.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began to\\r\\nlaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing was\\r\\nleft but the silver shoes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that she\\r\\ndried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes are\\r\\nyours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked up\\r\\nthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said one\\r\\nof the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but what\\r\\nit is we never knew.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then she\\r\\ncame out again to the Munchkins and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they will\\r\\nworry about me. Can you help me find my way?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy,\\r\\nand then shook their heads.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a great\\r\\ndesert, and none could live to cross it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have been\\r\\nthere and seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at the\\r\\nWest. And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch of\\r\\nthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edge\\r\\nis the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I’m afraid, my\\r\\ndear, you will have to live with us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strange\\r\\npeople. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for they\\r\\nimmediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As for the\\r\\nlittle old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of her\\r\\nnose, while she counted “One, two, three” in a solemn voice. At\\r\\nonce the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalk\\r\\nmarks:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words on\\r\\nit, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\\r\\nGreat Wizard I told you of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\\r\\nhave never seen him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimes\\r\\npleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magic\\r\\narts I know of to keep you from harm.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun to\\r\\nlook upon the little old woman as her only friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you my\\r\\nkiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\\r\\nthe North.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where her lips\\r\\ntouched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon\\r\\nafter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” said\\r\\nthe Witch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\\r\\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, after\\r\\nwhich they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendly\\r\\nlittle nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightway\\r\\ndisappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudly\\r\\nenough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while she\\r\\nstood by.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in just\\r\\nthat way, and was not surprised in the least.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III\\r\\nHow Dorothy Saved the Scarecrow\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy was left alone she began to feel hungry. So she went to the\\r\\ncupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter. She gave\\r\\nsome to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the\\r\\nlittle brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. Toto ran over to the\\r\\ntrees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him,\\r\\nand saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered some\\r\\nof it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a good\\r\\ndrink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey to\\r\\nthe City of Emeralds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hanging\\r\\non a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and\\r\\nalthough the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty\\r\\nfrock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham,\\r\\nand tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled it\\r\\nwith bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then she\\r\\nlooked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. And\\r\\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail to\\r\\nshow he knew what she meant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\\r\\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They would\\r\\nbe just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fitted\\r\\nher as well as if they had been made for her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally she picked up her basket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald City\\r\\nand ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of her\\r\\ndress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find the one\\r\\npaved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking briskly toward\\r\\nthe Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow\\r\\nroad-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not\\r\\nfeel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly\\r\\nwhisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about\\r\\nher. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue\\r\\ncolor, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance.\\r\\nEvidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Once\\r\\nin a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and\\r\\nbow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying\\r\\nthe Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of the\\r\\nMunchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for a\\r\\nroof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the\\r\\nfavorite color.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nToward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonder\\r\\nwhere she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than the\\r\\nrest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five little\\r\\nfiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing and\\r\\nsinging, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts,\\r\\npies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass the\\r\\nnight with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in the\\r\\nland, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom from\\r\\nthe bondage of the Wicked Witch.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself,\\r\\nwhose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a great\\r\\nsorceress.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why?” asked the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides,\\r\\nyou have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wear\\r\\nwhite.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing out\\r\\nthe wrinkles in it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is the\\r\\ncolor of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a\\r\\nfriendly witch.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to think\\r\\nher a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl who\\r\\nhad come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where he\\r\\ngave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made of blue cloth,\\r\\nand Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the blue\\r\\nrug beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played with\\r\\nToto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amused\\r\\nDorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen a\\r\\ndog before.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never been\\r\\nthere. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have business\\r\\nwith him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you many\\r\\ndays. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through rough\\r\\nand dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could help\\r\\nher get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellow\\r\\nbrick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, and\\r\\nso climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was a\\r\\ngreat cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed\\r\\nhigh on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow.\\r\\nIts head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouth\\r\\npainted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belonged\\r\\nto some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was a\\r\\nblue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.\\r\\nOn the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in this\\r\\ncountry, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the\\r\\npole stuck up its back.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\\r\\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. She\\r\\nthought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows in\\r\\nKansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendly\\r\\nway. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ran\\r\\naround the pole and barked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely.\\r\\n“How do you do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile,\\r\\n“for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away\\r\\ncrows.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away the\\r\\npole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, being\\r\\nstuffed with straw, it was quite light.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been set\\r\\ndown on the ground. “I feel like a new man.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak,\\r\\nand to see him bow and walk along beside her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself\\r\\nand yawned. “And where are you going?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to the\\r\\nEmerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired. “And who is\\r\\nOz?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I\\r\\nhave no brains at all,” he answered sadly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City with\\r\\nyou, that Oz would give me some brains?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, if\\r\\nyou like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\\r\\nare now.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” he\\r\\ncontinued confidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and body\\r\\nbeing stuffed, because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks\\r\\na pin into me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it. But I do not\\r\\nwant people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw instead\\r\\nof with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was truly\\r\\nsorry for him. “If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all he\\r\\ncan for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” he answered gratefully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and they\\r\\nstarted along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled around the\\r\\nstuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, and\\r\\nhe often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “He\\r\\nnever bites.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “He\\r\\ncan’t hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall not\\r\\nmind it, for I can’t get tired. I’ll tell you a secret,” he\\r\\ncontinued, as he walked along. “There is only one thing in the world I am\\r\\nafraid of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who made\\r\\nyou?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it’s a lighted\\r\\nmatch.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV\\r\\nThe Road Through the Forest\\n\\r\\nAfter a few hours the road began to be rough, and the walking grew so difficult\\r\\nthat the Scarecrow often stumbled over the yellow bricks, which were here very\\r\\nuneven. Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leaving\\r\\nholes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the Scarecrow,\\r\\nhaving no brains, he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes and\\r\\nfell at full length on the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothy\\r\\nwould pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her in\\r\\nlaughing merrily at his own mishap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back.\\r\\nThere were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the\\r\\nmore dismal and lonesome the country became.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy opened\\r\\nher basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but he\\r\\nrefused.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I am\\r\\nnot, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I could\\r\\neat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shape\\r\\nof my head.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on eating\\r\\nher bread.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,”\\r\\nsaid the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all about\\r\\nKansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried her\\r\\nto this queer Land of Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why you\\r\\nshould wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray place\\r\\nyou call Kansas.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is because you have no brains” answered the girl. “No\\r\\nmatter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would\\r\\nrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There is\\r\\nno place like home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said. “If your heads\\r\\nwere stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in the\\r\\nbeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunate\\r\\nfor Kansas that you have brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked the\\r\\nchild.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\\r\\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time is\\r\\nall unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the first\\r\\nthings he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on. There\\r\\nwas another Munchkin with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmer\\r\\nsaying, ‘How do you like those ears?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They are\\r\\nears just the same,’” which was true enough.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. So\\r\\nhe painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking\\r\\nat him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was\\r\\nmy first glimpse of the world.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked the\\r\\nMunchkin who was watching the farmer. “‘Blue paint is just the\\r\\ncolor for eyes.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’”\\r\\nsaid the farmer. And when the second eye was done I could see much better than\\r\\nbefore. Then he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that\\r\\ntime I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them\\r\\nmake my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last,\\r\\nI felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said the\\r\\nfarmer. ‘He looks just like a man.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed with\\r\\nhim. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\\r\\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked away and\\r\\nleft me alone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\\r\\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole.\\r\\nIt was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been made\\r\\nsuch a little while before. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield,\\r\\nbut as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; and\\r\\nthis pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person. By and\\r\\nby an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon\\r\\nmy shoulder and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.\\r\\nAny crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Then\\r\\nhe hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\\r\\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short time\\r\\nthere was a great flock of them about me.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow after\\r\\nall; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had brains in\\r\\nyour head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than some\\r\\nof them. Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matter\\r\\nwhether one is a crow or a man.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\\r\\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off the\\r\\nstake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soon\\r\\nas we get to the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxious\\r\\nto have them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is such\\r\\nan uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed the\\r\\nbasket to the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough and\\r\\nuntilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew so\\r\\nbig and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick.\\r\\nIt was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; but\\r\\nthe travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow,\\r\\n“and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must go\\r\\nwherever it leads us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have said\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling\\r\\nalong in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for some\\r\\ndogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as well\\r\\nas by day. So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,”\\r\\nshe said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in the\\r\\ndark.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSoon after the Scarecrow stopped.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “built\\r\\nof logs and branches. Shall we go there?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tired\\r\\nout.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, and\\r\\nDorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down at\\r\\nonce, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, who\\r\\nwas never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morning\\r\\ncame.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V\\r\\nThe Rescue of the Tin Woodman\\n\\r\\nWhen Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long been\\r\\nout chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and looked around her.\\r\\nThere was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting for\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why do you want water?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so the\\r\\ndry bread will not stick in my throat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrow\\r\\nthoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you have\\r\\nbrains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a little\\r\\nspring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast.\\r\\nShe saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankful\\r\\nthe Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough for\\r\\nherself and Toto for the day.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow\\r\\nbrick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What was that?” she asked timidly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go and\\r\\nsee.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJust then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come from\\r\\nbehind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, when\\r\\nDorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between the\\r\\ntrees. She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry of\\r\\nsurprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it,\\r\\nwith an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin. His head and\\r\\narms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as\\r\\nif he could not stir at all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barked\\r\\nsharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaning\\r\\nfor more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved by\\r\\nthe sad voice in which the man spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They are\\r\\nrusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\\r\\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she\\r\\nreturned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and\\r\\nas it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved\\r\\nit gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn\\r\\nit himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled them\\r\\nand the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and\\r\\nas good as new.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which he\\r\\nleaned against the tree.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is a great comfort,” he said. “I have been holding that\\r\\naxe in the air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put it\\r\\ndown at last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\\r\\nonce more.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked them\\r\\nagain and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and very\\r\\ngrateful.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” he\\r\\nsaid; “so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be\\r\\nhere?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” she\\r\\nanswered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to put\\r\\na few brains into his head,” she replied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered. “It would be as easy as\\r\\nto give the Scarecrow brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“True,” the Tin Woodman returned. “So, if you will allow me\\r\\nto join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that\\r\\nshe would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axe\\r\\nand they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that was\\r\\npaved with yellow brick.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.\\r\\n“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rust\\r\\nagain, I would need the oil-can badly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soon\\r\\nafter they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the trees\\r\\nand branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass. But\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he\\r\\ncleared a passage for the entire party.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not notice\\r\\nwhen the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of the\\r\\nroad. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully.\\r\\n“My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to\\r\\nOz to ask him for some brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brains\\r\\nare not the best things in the world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But once\\r\\nI had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\\r\\nrather have a heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told the\\r\\nfollowing story:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest and\\r\\nsold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a woodchopper, and\\r\\nafter my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then I\\r\\nmade up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might not\\r\\nbecome lonely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\\r\\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me as\\r\\nsoon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set to\\r\\nwork harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman who did not want\\r\\nher to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with her\\r\\nand do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch\\r\\nof the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the\\r\\nmarriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\\r\\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife as\\r\\nsoon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\\r\\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had him\\r\\nmake me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it.\\r\\nBut my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised the\\r\\nold woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began chopping\\r\\nagain, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith,\\r\\nand again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my\\r\\narms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin\\r\\nones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first\\r\\nI thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, and\\r\\nhe made me a new head out of tin.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\\r\\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new way\\r\\nto kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again,\\r\\nso that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once more\\r\\nthe tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin arms\\r\\nand legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around as\\r\\nwell as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for the\\r\\nMunchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is\\r\\nstill living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and it\\r\\ndid not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was only\\r\\none danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottage\\r\\nand took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a day\\r\\nwhen I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought of\\r\\nthe danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until you\\r\\ncame to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year I\\r\\nstood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss\\r\\nof my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one\\r\\ncan love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. If\\r\\nhe does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of the\\r\\nTin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brains\\r\\ninstead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\\r\\none.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “for\\r\\nbrains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the\\r\\nworld.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her two\\r\\nfriends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas and\\r\\nAunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and the\\r\\nScarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for\\r\\nherself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither the Woodman nor\\r\\nthe Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, and\\r\\ncould not live unless she was fed.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI\\r\\nThe Cowardly Lion\\n\\r\\nAll this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the thick\\r\\nwoods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much covered\\r\\nby dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not at\\r\\nall good.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the open\\r\\ncountry where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deep\\r\\ngrowl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made the\\r\\nlittle girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; but\\r\\nToto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side, and did not even bark\\r\\nin return.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman,\\r\\n“before we are out of the forest?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been to\\r\\nthe Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said\\r\\nit was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the city\\r\\nwhere Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I have\\r\\nmy oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon your\\r\\nforehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that will protect you\\r\\nfrom harm.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protect\\r\\nhim?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the Tin\\r\\nWoodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the next\\r\\nmoment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent the\\r\\nScarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck at\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But, to the Lion’s surprise, he\\r\\ncould make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road\\r\\nand lay still.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, and\\r\\nthe great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearing\\r\\nToto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped the\\r\\nLion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself,\\r\\na big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose\\r\\nwith his paw where Dorothy had hit it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but a\\r\\nbig coward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame.\\r\\n“I’ve always known it. But how can I help it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffed\\r\\nman, like the poor Scarecrow!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick\\r\\nup the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shape\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was still\\r\\nangry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion.\\r\\n“It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed\\r\\nalso?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And she\\r\\nhelped the Woodman up again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion.\\r\\n“When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my\\r\\nback. What is that little animal you are so tender of?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I\\r\\nlook at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a coward\\r\\nlike me,” continued the Lion sadly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the great\\r\\nbeast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I was\\r\\nborn that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be\\r\\nbrave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned\\r\\nthat if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out of\\r\\nmy way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but I\\r\\njust roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If the\\r\\nelephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I should\\r\\nhave run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they hear me\\r\\nroar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be a\\r\\ncoward,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the\\r\\ntip of his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.\\r\\nBut whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It may be,” said the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to be\\r\\nglad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot\\r\\nhave heart disease.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart I\\r\\nshould not be a coward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarked\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,”\\r\\nadded Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said the\\r\\nLion, “for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you will\\r\\nhelp to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\\r\\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’t\\r\\nmake me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be\\r\\nunhappy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking with\\r\\nstately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of this new\\r\\ncomrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushed\\r\\nbetween the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease,\\r\\nand presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDuring the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace of\\r\\ntheir journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that was\\r\\ncrawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the Tin\\r\\nWoodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any living\\r\\ncreature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret.\\r\\nThese tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and there\\r\\nthey rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman could\\r\\nnot open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He became\\r\\ngreatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, but\\r\\nshe could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. But\\r\\nthe Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and oiled the\\r\\nWoodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well as\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where I\\r\\nstep. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, and\\r\\ncrying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he saw\\r\\na tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The Tin\\r\\nWoodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care never\\r\\nto be cruel or unkind to anything.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guide\\r\\nyou, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be very\\r\\ncareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind so\\r\\nmuch.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII\\r\\nThe Journey to the Great Oz\\n\\r\\nThey were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, for\\r\\nthere were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect them\\r\\nfrom the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe and\\r\\nDorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely.\\r\\nShe and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what they\\r\\nwould do for breakfast.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest and\\r\\nkill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\\r\\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very good\\r\\nbreakfast.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “I\\r\\nshould certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no one\\r\\never knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow found\\r\\na tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so that she\\r\\nwould not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind and\\r\\nthoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way in\\r\\nwhich the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy and\\r\\nthe nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket.\\r\\nBut the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for it\\r\\nenabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his\\r\\nstraw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and\\r\\nonly came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.\\r\\nThese kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, and\\r\\nsoon after they all started toward the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walking\\r\\nan hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road and\\r\\ndivided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wide\\r\\nditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see it\\r\\nwas also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. The\\r\\nsides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment it\\r\\nseemed that their journey must end.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and the\\r\\nLion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can we\\r\\nclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we must\\r\\nstop where we are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, after\\r\\nmeasuring the distance carefully in his mind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you can\\r\\ncarry us all over on your back, one at a time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will go\\r\\nfirst?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that you\\r\\ncould not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badly\\r\\ndented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much,\\r\\nfor the fall would not hurt me at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion,\\r\\n“but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back and\\r\\nwe will make the attempt.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to the\\r\\nedge of the gulf and crouched down.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” he\\r\\nreplied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safely\\r\\non the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,\\r\\nand after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across the\\r\\nditch again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed on\\r\\nthe Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand. The next\\r\\nmoment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before she\\r\\nhad time to think about it, she was safe on the other side. The Lion went back\\r\\na third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a few\\r\\nmoments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made his\\r\\nbreath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy.\\r\\nAfter the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silently\\r\\nwondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of the\\r\\nwoods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, they\\r\\nsoon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whispered\\r\\nto them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\\r\\ntigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp that\\r\\nthey could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terribly\\r\\nafraid of the Kalidahs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy.\\r\\n“They must be dreadful beasts.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across the\\r\\nroad. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he could\\r\\nnot leap across it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought the\\r\\nScarecrow said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman\\r\\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across it\\r\\neasily.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almost\\r\\nsuspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree was\\r\\nsoon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front legs against\\r\\nthe tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fell\\r\\nwith a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made them\\r\\nall look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beasts\\r\\nwith bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to\\r\\ntremble.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned to\\r\\nface the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothy\\r\\nscreamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beasts\\r\\nstopped short and looked at him in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were two\\r\\nof them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lion\\r\\ncrossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next. Without\\r\\nstopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And the\\r\\nLion said to Dorothy:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\\r\\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\\r\\nalive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what\\r\\nwas best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of the\\r\\ntree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to use his\\r\\naxe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fell\\r\\nwith a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, and\\r\\nboth were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief,\\r\\n“I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it,\\r\\nfor it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creatures\\r\\nfrightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart to\\r\\nbeat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of the\\r\\nforest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride on\\r\\nthe Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner the farther\\r\\nthey advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river,\\r\\nflowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of the water they could see\\r\\nthe road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with green\\r\\nmeadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hanging\\r\\nfull of delicious fruits. They were greatly pleased to see this delightful\\r\\ncountry before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The Tin\\r\\nWoodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft,\\r\\nand while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree full\\r\\nof fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day,\\r\\nand she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiring\\r\\nas the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done. So they found a\\r\\ncozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothy\\r\\ndreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send her\\r\\nback to her own home again.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VIII\\r\\nThe Deadly Poppy Field\\n\\r\\nOur little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full of\\r\\nhope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from the\\r\\ntrees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safely\\r\\nthrough, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was a\\r\\nlovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But the\\r\\nraft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs and\\r\\nfastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy sat\\r\\ndown in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the Cowardly\\r\\nLion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and they\\r\\nhad long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of the\\r\\nriver the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther away\\r\\nfrom the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poles\\r\\nwould not touch the bottom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get to\\r\\nthe land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,\\r\\nand she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” the\\r\\nScarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fast\\r\\nin the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it out\\r\\nagain—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow was\\r\\nleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leave\\r\\nhim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that he\\r\\nmight rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOf course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought.\\r\\n“Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believe\\r\\nscare the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuck\\r\\non a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never have any brains,\\r\\nafter all!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDown the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind.\\r\\nThen the Lion said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore and\\r\\npull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of my\\r\\ntail.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail.\\r\\nThen the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore. It was hard\\r\\nwork, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current,\\r\\nand then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s long pole and helped push the\\r\\nraft to the land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped off\\r\\nupon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carried\\r\\nthem a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay down\\r\\non the grass to let the sun dry him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to the\\r\\nroad again,” remarked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started along\\r\\nthe grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was a\\r\\nlovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheer\\r\\nthem, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could have\\r\\nbeen very happy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick a\\r\\nbeautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:\\r\\n“Look!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his pole\\r\\nin the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So they\\r\\nsat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flew\\r\\nby, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water’s edge.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends,\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the Emerald\\r\\nCity.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted her\\r\\nlong neck and looked sharply at the queer party.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost the\\r\\nScarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is he?” asked the Stork.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,”\\r\\nremarked the Stork.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for he\\r\\nis stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank you\\r\\never and ever so much.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he is\\r\\ntoo heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where the\\r\\nScarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her great claws\\r\\ngrabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back to\\r\\nthe bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so happy that\\r\\nhe hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he sang\\r\\n“Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,\\r\\n“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall find\\r\\nthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying along\\r\\nbeside them. “I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now,\\r\\nfor my babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the Emerald\\r\\nCity and that Oz will help you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into the\\r\\nair and was soon out of sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds and\\r\\nlooking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground was\\r\\ncarpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and blue and purple\\r\\nblossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant in\\r\\ncolor they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed in\\r\\nthe spicy scent of the bright flowers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains,\\r\\nI shall probably like them better.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem so\\r\\nhelpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer and\\r\\nfewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of a\\r\\ngreat meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of these\\r\\nflowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it falls\\r\\nasleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers,\\r\\nhe sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she get\\r\\naway from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently her\\r\\neyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick before\\r\\ndark,” he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walking\\r\\nuntil Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself and\\r\\nshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “The\\r\\nsmell of the flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyes\\r\\nopen, and the dog is asleep already.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the Scarecrow\\r\\nand the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent of\\r\\nthe flowers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out of\\r\\nthis deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl with\\r\\nus, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go. In a\\r\\nmoment he was out of sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said the\\r\\nScarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, and\\r\\nthen they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for the\\r\\narms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowers\\r\\nthat surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, and\\r\\nat last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies.\\r\\nThe flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last,\\r\\nand fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweet\\r\\ngrass spread in beautiful green fields before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly;\\r\\n“for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep on\\r\\nforever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a very\\r\\ngood comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enough\\r\\nfrom the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of the\\r\\nflowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for the\\r\\nfresh breeze to waken her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IX\\r\\nThe Queen of the Field Mice\\n\\r\\n“We cannot be far from the road of yellow brick, now,” remarked the\\r\\nScarecrow, as he stood beside the girl, “for we have come nearly as far\\r\\nas the river carried us away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman was about to reply when he heard a low growl, and turning his\\r\\nhead (which worked beautifully on hinges) he saw a strange beast come bounding\\r\\nover the grass toward them. It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and the\\r\\nWoodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close to\\r\\nits head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while its\\r\\nred eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw that\\r\\nrunning before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had no\\r\\nheart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,\\r\\nharmless creature.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quick\\r\\nblow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it rolled\\r\\nover at his feet in two pieces.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; and\\r\\ncoming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman.\\r\\n“I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who may\\r\\nneed a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, I\\r\\nam a Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in saving\\r\\nmy life,” added the Queen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legs\\r\\ncould carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage to\\r\\nescape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen that\\r\\nthey almost stood upon their heads.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat and\\r\\nsaved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightest\\r\\nwish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then they\\r\\nscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and seeing\\r\\nall these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into the\\r\\nmiddle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived in\\r\\nKansas, and he saw no harm in it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while he\\r\\ncalled to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurt\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump of\\r\\ngrass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not bite\\r\\nus?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not be\\r\\nafraid.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again, although\\r\\nhe tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have bitten him had\\r\\nhe not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one of the biggest mice\\r\\nspoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you for\\r\\nsaving the life of our Queen?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow,\\r\\nwho had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed with\\r\\nstraw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the Cowardly\\r\\nLion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us all\\r\\nup.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is a\\r\\ncoward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really?” asked the Mouse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he would\\r\\nnever hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promise\\r\\nthat he shall treat you all with kindness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall we\\r\\ndo?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing to\\r\\nobey you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let each\\r\\none bring a long piece of string.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once and\\r\\nget all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in every\\r\\ndirection as fast as possible.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go to\\r\\nthose trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made a\\r\\ntruck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves and\\r\\nbranches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels out\\r\\nof short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast and so well did he work that by\\r\\nthe time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice and\\r\\nlittle mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string in\\r\\nhis mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep and\\r\\nopened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon the\\r\\ngrass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly. But\\r\\nthe Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified little\\r\\nMouse, he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she became\\r\\nquite friendly with the little girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, using\\r\\nthe strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck of\\r\\neach mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousand\\r\\ntimes bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the mice\\r\\nhad been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrow\\r\\nand the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queer\\r\\nlittle horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to get\\r\\nhim up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order to\\r\\nstart, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they also\\r\\nwould fall asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir the\\r\\nheavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed from\\r\\nbehind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppy\\r\\nbed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again,\\r\\ninstead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving her\\r\\ncompanion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he had\\r\\nbeen rescued.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through the\\r\\ngrass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into the\\r\\nfield and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance.\\r\\nGood-bye!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, while\\r\\nDorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and the\\r\\nScarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for her\\r\\ndinner.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter X\\r\\nThe Guardian of the Gate\\n\\r\\nIt was some time before the Cowardly Lion awakened, for he had lain among the\\r\\npoppies a long while, breathing in their deadly fragrance; but when he did open\\r\\nhis eyes and roll off the truck he was very glad to find himself still alive.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I ran as fast as I could,” he said, sitting down and yawning,\\r\\n“but the flowers were too strong for me. How did you get me out?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved him\\r\\nfrom death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such little\\r\\nthings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice have\\r\\nsaved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we do\\r\\nnow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,”\\r\\nsaid Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they all\\r\\nstarted upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, fresh\\r\\ngrass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick and\\r\\nturned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful,\\r\\nso that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with it\\r\\nthe many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could see\\r\\nfences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they came\\r\\nto a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was painted\\r\\ngreen. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, and\\r\\nsometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like to\\r\\nask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the great\\r\\nLion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed in\\r\\nclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of the\\r\\nMunchkins.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we are\\r\\nsurely getting near the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here,\\r\\nwhile in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But the\\r\\npeople do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid we\\r\\nshall be unable to find a place to pass the night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl,\\r\\n“and I’m sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next house\\r\\nand talk to the people.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to the\\r\\ndoor and knocked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do you\\r\\nwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,”\\r\\nanswered Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would not\\r\\nhurt you for the world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. He\\r\\nwill be more afraid of you than you are of him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking another\\r\\npeep at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will give\\r\\nyou some supper and a place to sleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, two\\r\\nchildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in a\\r\\ncorner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and while\\r\\nthe woman was busy laying the table the man asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where are you all going?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the Great\\r\\nOz.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz will\\r\\nsee you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not?” she replied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I have\\r\\nbeen to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place;\\r\\nbut I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of any\\r\\nliving person who has seen him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, and\\r\\neven those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is he like?” asked the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see,\\r\\nOz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\\r\\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say he\\r\\nlooks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, or\\r\\nin any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in his\\r\\nown form, no living person can tell.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, in\\r\\nsome way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “He\\r\\nhas more brains than he needs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has a\\r\\nlarge collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,\\r\\n“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over.\\r\\nHe will be glad to give you some.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it is\\r\\nmy home, and I’m sure it’s somewhere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansas\\r\\nfor you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; for\\r\\nthe Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way.\\r\\nBut what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only wagged\\r\\nhis tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around the\\r\\ntable and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs and\\r\\na plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion ate some of the\\r\\nporridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats were\\r\\nfood for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothing\\r\\nat all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supper\\r\\nagain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her,\\r\\nwhile the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. The\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night,\\r\\nalthough of course they could not sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, and\\r\\nsoon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemed\\r\\nthat at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoon\\r\\nbefore they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high and\\r\\nthick and of a bright green color.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate,\\r\\nall studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the painted\\r\\neyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard a\\r\\nsilvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they all\\r\\npassed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of which\\r\\nglistened with countless emeralds.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He was\\r\\nclothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of a\\r\\ngreenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wish\\r\\nin the Emerald City?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,\\r\\nshaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if you\\r\\ncome on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the Great\\r\\nWizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied the\\r\\nScarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\\r\\nWizard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the Emerald\\r\\nCity wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\\r\\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. I\\r\\nam the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I must\\r\\ntake you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\\r\\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\\r\\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when the\\r\\nCity was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles of\\r\\nevery size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian of\\r\\nthe Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes.\\r\\nThere were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of her\\r\\nhead, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of a\\r\\nchain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on,\\r\\nDorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\\r\\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and\\r\\nthe Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he was\\r\\nready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on the\\r\\nwall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal into\\r\\nthe streets of the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI\\r\\nThe Wonderful City of Oz\\n\\r\\nEven with eyes protected by the green spectacles, Dorothy and her friends were\\r\\nat first dazzled by the brilliancy of the wonderful City. The streets were\\r\\nlined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywhere\\r\\nwith sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble,\\r\\nand where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely,\\r\\nand glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of green\\r\\nglass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sun\\r\\nwere green.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, and\\r\\nthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked at\\r\\nDorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and the\\r\\nchildren all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; but\\r\\nno one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw that\\r\\neverything in them was green. Green candy and green pop corn were offered for\\r\\nsale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. At\\r\\none place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought it\\r\\nDorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried things\\r\\naround in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemed\\r\\nhappy and contented and prosperous.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a big\\r\\nbuilding, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, the\\r\\nGreat Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniform\\r\\nand wearing a long green beard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him,\\r\\n“and they demand to see the Great Oz.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry your\\r\\nmessage to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with a\\r\\ngreen carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier made\\r\\nthem all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and when\\r\\nthey were seated he said politely:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the Throne\\r\\nRoom and tell Oz you are here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at last, he\\r\\ncame back, Dorothy asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have you seen Oz?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But I\\r\\nspoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said he\\r\\nwill grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enter\\r\\nhis presence alone, and he will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you must\\r\\nremain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where you\\r\\nmay rest in comfort after your journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind of\\r\\nOz.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed in\\r\\na pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely green hair and green\\r\\neyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said, “Follow me and I will\\r\\nshow you your room.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog in\\r\\nher arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights of\\r\\nstairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was the\\r\\nsweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheets\\r\\nof green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall\\r\\nback into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers\\r\\nstood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\\r\\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer green\\r\\npictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; and\\r\\nall of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “and\\r\\nif you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led to\\r\\nrooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of the\\r\\nPalace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when he\\r\\nfound himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within the\\r\\ndoorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he could\\r\\nnot close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider which\\r\\nwas weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the\\r\\nmost wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\\r\\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being able\\r\\nto sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure they\\r\\nkept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leaves\\r\\nin the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too much\\r\\nsense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up\\r\\nlike a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, and\\r\\nshe dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin.\\r\\nDorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto’s\\r\\nneck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of the\\r\\ncourt, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to do but talk to\\r\\neach other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning,\\r\\nalthough they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked at\\r\\nher curiously, and one of them whispered:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her message\\r\\nto the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\\r\\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you came\\r\\nfrom. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silver\\r\\nshoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about the mark upon your\\r\\nforehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is the\\r\\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself in\\r\\na wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and the\\r\\nwalls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closely\\r\\ntogether. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun,\\r\\nwhich made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stood\\r\\nin the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems,\\r\\nas did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head,\\r\\nwithout a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hair\\r\\nupon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger than\\r\\nthe head of the biggest giant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly and\\r\\nlooked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard a\\r\\nvoice say:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek\\r\\nme?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head;\\r\\nso she took courage and answered:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where did you get the silver shoes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on her\\r\\nand killed her,” she replied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued the\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\\r\\ngood-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth.\\r\\nThen Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” she\\r\\nanswered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is so\\r\\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being away\\r\\nso long.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down to\\r\\nthe floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part of\\r\\nthe room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard and\\r\\nI am only a little girl.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,”\\r\\nsaid Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could not\\r\\nhelp it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You have\\r\\nno right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me\\r\\nin return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If you\\r\\nwish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something for\\r\\nme first. Help me and I will help you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What must I do?” asked the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\\r\\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land,\\r\\nand when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas—but\\r\\nnot before.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyes\\r\\nwinked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that she\\r\\ncould help him if she would.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if I\\r\\nwanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and\\r\\nTerrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, and\\r\\nuntil the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again.\\r\\nRemember that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought to\\r\\nbe killed. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your\\r\\ntask.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her.\\r\\n“There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will not\\r\\nsend me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I can\\r\\nnever do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHer friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy went to\\r\\nher own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room,\\r\\nwhere he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady. She was\\r\\ndressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown of\\r\\njewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so light\\r\\nthat they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him,\\r\\nbefore this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek\\r\\nme?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told him\\r\\nof, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,\\r\\nand I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw,\\r\\nso that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”\\r\\nanswered the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “but\\r\\nthis much I will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West,\\r\\nI will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you will\\r\\nbe the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said the\\r\\nScarecrow, in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I will\\r\\nnot grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned the\\r\\nbrains you so greatly desire.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz had\\r\\nsaid; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head,\\r\\nas she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart as\\r\\nmuch as the Tin Woodman.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodman\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He did not\\r\\nknow whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would be\\r\\nthe lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is the\\r\\nhead, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of its\\r\\nown and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beg\\r\\nhard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindly\\r\\nhearted.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head nor\\r\\nthe Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly as\\r\\nbig as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to hold\\r\\nits weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there were\\r\\nfive eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body, and\\r\\nit also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it,\\r\\nand a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the\\r\\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fast\\r\\nfrom terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although he\\r\\nwas much disappointed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice that\\r\\nwas one great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot\\r\\nlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answered\\r\\nthe Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire a\\r\\nheart, you must earn it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How?” asked the Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied the\\r\\nBeast. “When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\\r\\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tell\\r\\nthem of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly at the many\\r\\nforms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and so\\r\\nfrighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely Lady, I\\r\\nshall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my bidding. And if he\\r\\nis the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all about\\r\\nthe room until he promises to give us what we desire. So be of good cheer, my\\r\\nfriends, for all will yet be well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the great\\r\\nThrone Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to his\\r\\nsurprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing he\\r\\ncould scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was that Oz had by\\r\\naccident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he tried to go nearer, the\\r\\nheat was so intense that it singed his whiskers, and he crept back tremblingly\\r\\nto a spot nearer the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words it\\r\\nspoke:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek\\r\\nme?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. I\\r\\ncame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may become\\r\\nthe King of Beasts, as men call me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power to\\r\\ngrant my request,” answered the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bring\\r\\nme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give you\\r\\ncourage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while he\\r\\nstood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that he\\r\\nturned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad to find his friends waiting\\r\\nfor him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “and\\r\\nthat is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, and\\r\\ndestroy her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy,\\r\\nbeginning to cry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall on\\r\\nyour green silk gown and spot it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I am\\r\\nsure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill the\\r\\nWitch,” said the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not be\\r\\nof much help to you, I am such a fool.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the Tin\\r\\nWoodman; “but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTherefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and the\\r\\nWoodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properly\\r\\noiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new paint\\r\\non his eyes that he might see better. The green girl, who was very kind to\\r\\nthem, filled Dorothy’s basket with good things to eat, and fastened a\\r\\nlittle bell around Toto’s neck with a green ribbon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they were\\r\\nawakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of the\\r\\nPalace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII\\r\\nThe Search for the Wicked Witch\\n\\r\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the Emerald\\r\\nCity until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived. This\\r\\nofficer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and then\\r\\nhe politely opened the gate for our friends.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “No\\r\\none ever wishes to go that way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows you\\r\\nare in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all her\\r\\nslaves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroy\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “No\\r\\none has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slaves\\r\\nof you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and fierce,\\r\\nand may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where the sun sets, and\\r\\nyou cannot fail to find her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walking\\r\\nover fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups.\\r\\nDorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now,\\r\\nto her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbon\\r\\naround Toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white as\\r\\nDorothy’s dress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground became\\r\\nrougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of the\\r\\nWest, and the ground was untilled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees to\\r\\noffer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion were\\r\\ntired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow keeping watch.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as a\\r\\ntelescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle,\\r\\nshe happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends all\\r\\nabout her. They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry to\\r\\nfind them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung around\\r\\nher neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves.\\r\\nThey had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them to\\r\\npieces.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader of\\r\\nthe wolves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one is\\r\\na girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear them\\r\\ninto small pieces.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed,\\r\\nfollowed by the others.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolves\\r\\ncoming.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and I\\r\\nwill meet them as they come.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of the\\r\\nwolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s head\\r\\nfrom its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axe\\r\\nanother wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the Tin\\r\\nWoodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf was\\r\\nkilled, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It was\\r\\na good fight, friend.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was quite\\r\\nfrightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodman\\r\\ntold her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, after\\r\\nwhich they started again upon their journey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle and\\r\\nlooked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her wolves\\r\\nlying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country. This made\\r\\nher angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStraightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough to\\r\\ndarken the sky.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to the\\r\\nstrangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions. When\\r\\nthe little girl saw them coming she was afraid.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and you\\r\\nwill not be harmed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up and\\r\\nstretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were frightened, as\\r\\nthese birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer. But\\r\\nthe King Crow said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted its\\r\\nneck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrow\\r\\ntwisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrow\\r\\ntwisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him. Then he called to\\r\\nhis companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap,\\r\\nshe got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nForthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black bees\\r\\ncame flying toward her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch,\\r\\nand the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and her\\r\\nfriends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrow\\r\\nhad decided what to do.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog and\\r\\nthe Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot sting\\r\\nthem.” This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion and\\r\\nheld Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at him\\r\\nand broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman at\\r\\nall. And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end of\\r\\nthe black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like little\\r\\nheaps of fine coal.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put the\\r\\nstraw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as ever. So they\\r\\nstarted upon their journey once more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps like\\r\\nfine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth.\\r\\nAnd then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave them\\r\\nsharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. So\\r\\nthey marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a great\\r\\nroar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that they\\r\\nran back as fast as they could.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap,\\r\\nand sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what she\\r\\nshould do next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy these\\r\\nstrangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one,\\r\\nand she soon made up her mind how to act.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubies\\r\\nrunning round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could call\\r\\nthree times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given.\\r\\nBut no person could command these strange creatures more than three times.\\r\\nTwice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when she\\r\\nhad made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country.\\r\\nThe Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she had\\r\\nfought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of the\\r\\nWest. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once more\\r\\ncould she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so until\\r\\nall her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and her\\r\\nwild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared away\\r\\nby the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothy\\r\\nand her friends.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it upon\\r\\nher head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said slowly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNext she stood upon her right foot and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound was\\r\\nheard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering and\\r\\nlaughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witch\\r\\nsurrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerful\\r\\nwings on his shoulders.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOne, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew close to\\r\\nthe Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last time. What\\r\\ndo you command?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all except\\r\\nthe Lion,” said the Wicked Witch. “Bring that beast to me, for I\\r\\nhave a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader. Then, with a\\r\\ngreat deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the place\\r\\nwhere Dorothy and her friends were walking.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the air\\r\\nuntil they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here they\\r\\ndropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he lay\\r\\nso battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOthers of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulled\\r\\nall of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat and boots and\\r\\nclothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound many\\r\\ncoils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratch\\r\\nor struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to the\\r\\nWitch’s castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high iron\\r\\nfence around it, so that he could not escape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,\\r\\nwatching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn.\\r\\nThe leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretched\\r\\nout and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the Good\\r\\nWitch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the others\\r\\nnot to touch her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “for\\r\\nshe is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power of\\r\\nEvil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leave\\r\\nher there.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried her\\r\\nswiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her down\\r\\nupon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the Witch:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girl\\r\\nwe dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your power over our band\\r\\nis now ended, and you will never see us again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flew\\r\\ninto the air and were soon out of sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark on\\r\\nDorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys nor\\r\\nshe, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked down at Dorothy’s\\r\\nfeet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knew\\r\\nwhat a powerful charm belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to run\\r\\naway from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the child’s eyes and saw\\r\\nhow simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know of\\r\\nthe wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to\\r\\nherself, and thought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does not\\r\\nknow how to use her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and\\r\\nseverely:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you do\\r\\nnot I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle until\\r\\nthey came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettles\\r\\nand sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as she\\r\\ncould; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the courtyard\\r\\nand harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure,\\r\\nto make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive. But as she\\r\\nopened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely that\\r\\nthe Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speaking\\r\\nthrough the bars of the gate, “I can starve you. You shall have nothing\\r\\nto eat until you do as I wish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she came\\r\\nto the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed like a\\r\\nhorse?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the Lion would answer, “No. If you come in this yard, I will bite\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that every\\r\\nnight, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard.\\r\\nAfter he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy would lie\\r\\nbeside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked of\\r\\ntheir troubles and tried to plan some way to escape. But they could find no way\\r\\nto get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies,\\r\\nwho were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she\\r\\ntold them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened to\\r\\nbeat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. But, in\\r\\ntruth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon her\\r\\nforehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself and\\r\\nToto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave little\\r\\ndog flew at her and bit her leg in return. The Witch did not bleed where she\\r\\nwas bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many years\\r\\nbefore.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would be\\r\\nharder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she would\\r\\ncry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into her\\r\\nface, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress. Toto\\r\\ndid not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long as\\r\\nDorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that made\\r\\nhim unhappy too.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoes\\r\\nwhich the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying in\\r\\nheaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; but\\r\\nif she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more power\\r\\nthan all the other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to see\\r\\nif she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the child\\r\\nwas so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at night\\r\\nand when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare\\r\\ngo in Dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water\\r\\nwas greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy was\\r\\nbathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touch\\r\\nher in any way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trick\\r\\nthat would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in the middle of\\r\\nthe kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to human\\r\\neyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar,\\r\\nnot being able to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt, but\\r\\nin her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it,\\r\\nthe Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as long\\r\\nas she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, and\\r\\nDorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, and\\r\\nsaid to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, and\\r\\nnot yours.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have no\\r\\nright to take my shoe from me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her,\\r\\n“and someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water that\\r\\nstood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nInstantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy looked\\r\\nat her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shall\\r\\nmelt away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was truly\\r\\nfrightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her\\r\\nvery eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked the\\r\\nWitch, in a wailing, despairing voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\\r\\ncastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a little\\r\\ngirl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Look\\r\\nout—here I go!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass and\\r\\nbegan to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she had\\r\\nreally melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threw\\r\\nit over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out the\\r\\nsilver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned and\\r\\ndried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last free\\r\\nto do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that the\\r\\nWicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longer\\r\\nprisoners in a strange land.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIII\\r\\nThe Rescue\\n\\r\\nThe Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had been\\r\\nmelted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of his\\r\\nprison and set him free. They went in together to the castle, where\\r\\nDorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell them\\r\\nthat they were no longer slaves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made to\\r\\nwork hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated them\\r\\nwith great cruelty. They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, and\\r\\nspent the time in feasting and dancing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only with\\r\\nus,” said the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girl\\r\\nanxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We can try,” answered the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescue\\r\\ntheir friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all in\\r\\ntheir power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage. So she chose a\\r\\nnumber of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all started\\r\\naway. They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rocky\\r\\nplain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him,\\r\\nbut the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to the\\r\\nYellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plight\\r\\nof her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry. When they reached the\\r\\ncastle Dorothy said to the Winkies:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then bring them to me,” she said. And when the tinsmiths came,\\r\\nbringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can you\\r\\nstraighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shape\\r\\nagain, and solder him together where he is broken?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that they\\r\\nthought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So they set to work\\r\\nin one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and four\\r\\nnights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing and\\r\\npounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he was\\r\\nstraightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. To\\r\\nbe sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job,\\r\\nand as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for rescuing\\r\\nhim, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe every\\r\\ntear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted.\\r\\nAt the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting her\\r\\nold friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for the\\r\\nLion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quite\\r\\nwet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the sun\\r\\ntill it dried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman,\\r\\nwhen Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “I\\r\\nshould be quite happy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must try to find him,” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part of\\r\\nthe next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the Winged\\r\\nMonkeys had tossed the Scarecrow’s clothes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climb\\r\\nit; but the Woodman said at once, “I’ll chop it down, and then we\\r\\ncan get the Scarecrow’s clothes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, another\\r\\nof the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold and\\r\\nfitted it to the Woodman’s axe, instead of the old broken handle. Others\\r\\npolished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened like\\r\\nburnished silver.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short time\\r\\nthe tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes fell\\r\\nout of the branches and rolled off on the ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, where\\r\\nthey were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow,\\r\\nas good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days at\\r\\nthe Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make them\\r\\ncomfortable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, “We must go back to\\r\\nOz, and claim his promise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get my\\r\\nheart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping her\\r\\nhands. “Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together and bade\\r\\nthem good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown so\\r\\nfond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and the\\r\\nYellow Land of the West. Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gave\\r\\nToto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented a\\r\\nbeautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave a\\r\\ngold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodman\\r\\nthey offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEvery one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and all\\r\\nshook hands with them until their arms ached.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for the\\r\\njourney, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own head and\\r\\nfound that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything about the charm of\\r\\nthe Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wear\\r\\nit and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City;\\r\\nand the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIV\\r\\nThe Winged Monkeys\\n\\r\\nYou will remember there was no road—not even a pathway—between the\\r\\ncastle of the Wicked Witch and the Emerald City. When the four travelers went\\r\\nin search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeys\\r\\nto bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the big\\r\\nfields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew,\\r\\nof course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they started\\r\\noff in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they did\\r\\nnot know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they were\\r\\nlost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the moon\\r\\ncame out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellow\\r\\nflowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if they\\r\\nwere quite sure which way they were going.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shall\\r\\nsometime come to some place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but the\\r\\nscarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we find\\r\\nit again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman. “It seems to me I\\r\\ncan scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very long\\r\\njourney.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “I\\r\\nhaven’t the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at her\\r\\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for the\\r\\nfirst time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past his\\r\\nhead. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to ask\\r\\nwhat they should do next.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested. “They could\\r\\nprobably tell us the way to the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow. “Why\\r\\ndidn’t we think of that before?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since the\\r\\nQueen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they heard the\\r\\npattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her.\\r\\nAmong them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can I do for my friends?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy. “Can you tell us where\\r\\nthe Emerald City is?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off,\\r\\nfor you have had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticed\\r\\nDorothy’s Golden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charm\\r\\nof the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the City\\r\\nof Oz in less than an hour.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, in\\r\\nsurprise. “What is it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of the\\r\\nMice. “But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away,\\r\\nfor they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!” And she\\r\\nscampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon the\\r\\nlining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directions\\r\\ncarefully and put the Cap upon her head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what she\\r\\nwas doing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time on\\r\\nher right foot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on both\\r\\nfeet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering and\\r\\nflapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is your\\r\\ncommand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and we\\r\\nhave lost our way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spoken\\r\\nthan two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.\\r\\nOthers took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkey\\r\\nseized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for they\\r\\nremembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they saw\\r\\nthat no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, and\\r\\nhad a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one of\\r\\nthem the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were careful\\r\\nnot to hurt her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh;\\r\\n“but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling\\r\\nyou about it, if you wish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, living\\r\\nhappily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit,\\r\\nand doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of us\\r\\nwere rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of the\\r\\nanimals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people who\\r\\nwalked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, and\\r\\nenjoyed every minute of the day. This was many years ago, long before Oz came\\r\\nout of the clouds to rule over this land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who was\\r\\nalso a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the people, and she\\r\\nwas never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and she\\r\\nlived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her,\\r\\nbut her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, since\\r\\nall the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and\\r\\nwise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise\\r\\nbeyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\\r\\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all her\\r\\nmagic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish.\\r\\nWhen he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best and\\r\\nwisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayelette\\r\\nloved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\\r\\nlived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved a\\r\\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\\r\\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside the\\r\\nriver. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and my\\r\\ngrandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flew\\r\\ndown and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over the\\r\\nmiddle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘and\\r\\nsee if the water has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise not\\r\\nto swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\\r\\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But when\\r\\nGayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined by\\r\\nthe river.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had all\\r\\nthe Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wings\\r\\nshould be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, and\\r\\ndropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeys\\r\\nwould drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind word\\r\\nfor them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that the\\r\\nWinged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of the\\r\\nGolden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is\\r\\nsaid to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\\r\\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how it\\r\\nhappens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap,\\r\\nwhosoever he may be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatly\\r\\ninterested in the story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied the\\r\\nMonkey, “he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride could\\r\\nnot bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he had\\r\\nmarried her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyes\\r\\non a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the hands\\r\\nof the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterward\\r\\ndrive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, and\\r\\nthree times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green,\\r\\nshining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flight\\r\\nof the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures set\\r\\nthe travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low to\\r\\nDorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was a good ride,” said the little girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion.\\r\\n“How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XV\\r\\nThe Discovery of Oz, the Terrible\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang the\\r\\nbell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of the\\r\\nGates they had met before.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What! are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man. “Who\\r\\nmelted her?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed\\r\\nbefore her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the great\\r\\nbox on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward they passed on\\r\\nthrough the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardian\\r\\nof the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they all\\r\\ngathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palace\\r\\nof Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but he\\r\\nlet them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, who\\r\\nshowed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until the\\r\\nGreat Oz was ready to receive them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the other\\r\\ntravelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz made\\r\\nno reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he did\\r\\nnot. They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next. The\\r\\nwaiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz should\\r\\ntreat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships and\\r\\nslavery. So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another message\\r\\nto Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call the\\r\\nWinged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.\\r\\nWhen the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent word\\r\\nfor them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o’clock\\r\\nthe next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West,\\r\\nand he did not wish to meet them again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz had\\r\\npromised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamed\\r\\nshe was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have her\\r\\nlittle girl at home again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPromptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier\\r\\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of the\\r\\nGreat Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had taken\\r\\nbefore, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one at\\r\\nall in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for the\\r\\nstillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they had\\r\\nseen Oz take.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere near\\r\\nthe top of the great dome, and it said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothy\\r\\nasked, “Where are you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes of\\r\\ncommon mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you\\r\\nmay converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\\r\\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a row\\r\\nwhile Dorothy said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What promise?” asked Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\\r\\ndestroyed,” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, and\\r\\nDorothy thought it trembled a little.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket of\\r\\nwater.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden! Well, come to me\\r\\ntomorrow, for I must have time to think it over.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’ve had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodman\\r\\nangrily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shan’t wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave a\\r\\nlarge, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away from\\r\\nhim in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner. As it fell with\\r\\na crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled with\\r\\nwonder. For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a little\\r\\nold man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much\\r\\nsurprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the\\r\\nlittle man and cried out, “Who are you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in a\\r\\ntrembling voice. “But don’t strike me—please\\r\\ndon’t—and I’ll do anything you want me to.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly. “I have\\r\\nbeen making believe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Making believe!” cried Dorothy. “Are you not a Great\\r\\nWizard?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hush, my dear,” he said. “Don’t speak so loud, or you\\r\\nwill be overheard—and I should be ruined. I’m supposed to be a\\r\\nGreat Wizard.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And aren’t you?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit of it, my dear; I’m just a common man.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’re more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grieved\\r\\ntone; “you’re a humbug.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands together\\r\\nas if it pleased him. “I am a humbug.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman. “How shall I\\r\\never get my heart?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his\\r\\neyes with his coat sleeve.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of these\\r\\nlittle things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at being\\r\\nfound out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” asked\\r\\nDorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz.\\r\\n“I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be found\\r\\nout. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I\\r\\nwill not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something\\r\\nterrible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But, I don’t understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment.\\r\\n“How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz. “Step this way,\\r\\nplease, and I will tell you all about it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they all\\r\\nfollowed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made out\\r\\nof many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz. “I stood\\r\\nbehind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth\\r\\nopen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how about the voice?” she inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man. “I can throw\\r\\nthe sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\\r\\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed the\\r\\nScarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovely\\r\\nLady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot of\\r\\nskins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball of\\r\\nFire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really a\\r\\nball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed of\\r\\nyourself for being such a humbug.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully;\\r\\n“but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty\\r\\nof chairs; and I will tell you my story.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was born in Omaha—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, that isn’t very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his head\\r\\nat her sadly. “When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was\\r\\nvery well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or\\r\\nbeast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears and\\r\\nlooked everywhere to see where she was. “After a time,” continued\\r\\nOz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is that?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\\r\\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” she said, “I know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so that\\r\\nI couldn’t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so far that\\r\\na current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away. For a day and\\r\\na night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day I\\r\\nawoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself in\\r\\nthe midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought I\\r\\nwas a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid of\\r\\nme, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\\r\\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then I\\r\\nthought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the Emerald\\r\\nCity; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people,\\r\\nso that everything they saw was green.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when you\\r\\nwear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\\r\\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when the\\r\\nballoon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worn\\r\\ngreen glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is an\\r\\nEmerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels and\\r\\nprecious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy. I have\\r\\nbeen good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace was\\r\\nbuilt, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\\r\\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\\r\\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they ruled the\\r\\npeople who live in the North and South and East and West. Fortunately, the\\r\\nWitches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm;\\r\\nbut the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they not\\r\\nthought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely have\\r\\ndestroyed me. As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so you\\r\\ncan imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked\\r\\nWitch of the East. When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if\\r\\nyou would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her,\\r\\nI am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, my dear; I’m really a very good man, but I’m a very\\r\\nbad Wizard, I must admit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Can’t you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You don’t need them. You are learning something every day. A baby\\r\\nhas brains, but it doesn’t know much. Experience is the only thing that\\r\\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you are\\r\\nsure to get.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall be\\r\\nvery unhappy unless you give me brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” he said with a sigh, “I’m not much of a\\r\\nmagician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff\\r\\nyour head with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must\\r\\nfind that out for yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“I’ll find a way to use them, never fear!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “All\\r\\nyou need is confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\\r\\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid,\\r\\nand that kind of courage you have in plenty.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I have, but I’m scared just the same,” said the\\r\\nLion. “I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of\\r\\ncourage that makes one forget he is afraid.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” replied\\r\\nOz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong to\\r\\nwant a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\\r\\nluck not to have a heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n“For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you\\r\\nwill give me the heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” answered Oz meekly. “Come to me tomorrow and you\\r\\nshall have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\\r\\ncontinue the part a little longer.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back to\\r\\nKansas?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man.\\r\\n“Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try to\\r\\nfind a way to carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be\\r\\ntreated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\\r\\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in return for\\r\\nmy help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no one I am a\\r\\nhumbug.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to their\\r\\nrooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and Terrible\\r\\nHumbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas,\\r\\nand if he did she was willing to forgive him everything.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVI\\r\\nThe Magic Art of the Great Humbug\\n\\r\\nNext morning the Scarecrow said to his friends:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Congratulate me. I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When I\\r\\nreturn I shall be as other men are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied. “But\\r\\nsurely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my new\\r\\nbrain is going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in a\\r\\ncheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come in,” said Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window,\\r\\nengaged in deep thought.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a little\\r\\nuneasily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz. “You\\r\\nmust excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order to\\r\\nput your brains in their proper place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow. “You are quite\\r\\nwelcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put it\\r\\non again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he entered\\r\\nthe back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great many\\r\\npins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top of\\r\\nthe Scarecrow’s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the space\\r\\nwith straw, to hold it in place.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said to\\r\\nhim, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot of\\r\\nbran-new brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatest\\r\\nwish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the top with\\r\\nbrains.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How do you feel?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly. “When I get used\\r\\nto my brains I shall know everything.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” asked\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman. So he\\r\\nwalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “I\\r\\nhave come for my heart.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” answered the little man. “But I shall have to\\r\\ncut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hope\\r\\nit won’t hurt you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman. “I shall not feel it at\\r\\nall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole in\\r\\nthe left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast. Then, going to a chest of\\r\\ndrawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed with\\r\\nsawdust.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased.\\r\\n“But is it a kind heart?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, very!” answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman’s\\r\\nbreast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together where\\r\\nit had been cut.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might be\\r\\nproud of. I’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it really\\r\\ncouldn’t be helped.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman. “I am\\r\\nvery grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t speak of it,” replied Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy on\\r\\naccount of his good fortune.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come in,” said Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering the\\r\\nroom.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it for\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square green\\r\\nbottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifully\\r\\ncarved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he did\\r\\nnot like it, the Wizard said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Drink.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is it?” asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would be\\r\\ncourage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that this\\r\\nreally cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I advise\\r\\nyou to drink it as soon as possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How do you feel now?” asked Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to his\\r\\nfriends to tell them of his good fortune.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow and\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. “How\\r\\ncan I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these people make me\\r\\ndo things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was easy to make the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could do\\r\\nanything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back to\\r\\nKansas, and I’m sure I don’t know how it can be done.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVII\\r\\nHow the Balloon Was Launched\\n\\r\\nFor three days Dorothy heard nothing from Oz. These were sad days for the\\r\\nlittle girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented. The\\r\\nScarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would not\\r\\nsay what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself.\\r\\nWhen the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in his\\r\\nbreast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tender\\r\\nheart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared he\\r\\nwas afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of the\\r\\nfierce Kalidahs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed more\\r\\nthan ever to get back to Kansas.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered the\\r\\nThrone Room he greeted her pleasantly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of this\\r\\ncountry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for I\\r\\nhaven’t the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to do\\r\\nis to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your way\\r\\nhome.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man.\\r\\n“You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came\\r\\nthrough the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\\r\\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers to\\r\\nmake a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I believe I\\r\\ncan make a balloon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated with\\r\\nglue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\\r\\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas to fill\\r\\nthe balloon with, to make it float.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be of\\r\\nno use to us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make it\\r\\nfloat, which is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas,\\r\\nfor if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and\\r\\nwe should be lost.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such a\\r\\nhumbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am\\r\\nnot a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. So\\r\\nI have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I’d\\r\\nmuch rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew the\\r\\nsilk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silk\\r\\ninto proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a strip\\r\\nof light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emerald\\r\\ngreen; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the color\\r\\nabout them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it was\\r\\nfinished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight,\\r\\nafter which he announced that the balloon was ready.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent the\\r\\nsoldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened\\r\\nwith many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make a\\r\\nvisit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The news spread\\r\\nrapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazed\\r\\nupon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood,\\r\\nand now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over the\\r\\nfire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag.\\r\\nGradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally the\\r\\nbasket just touched the ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow will\\r\\nrule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to the\\r\\nground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter in\\r\\nweight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard. “Hurry up, or the balloon\\r\\nwill fly away.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did not\\r\\nwish to leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at a\\r\\nkitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran towards the\\r\\nballoon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help her\\r\\ninto the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the air\\r\\nwithout her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come back!” she screamed. “I want to go, too!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can’t come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket.\\r\\n“Good-bye!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward to\\r\\nwhere the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther and\\r\\nfarther into the sky.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, though\\r\\nhe may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But the\\r\\npeople remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us this\\r\\nbeautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow to\\r\\nrule over us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStill, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, and\\r\\nwould not be comforted.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XVIII\\r\\nAway to the South\\n\\r\\nDorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again;\\r\\nbut when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon.\\r\\nAnd she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman came to her and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gave\\r\\nme my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if you\\r\\nwill kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once. Then\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefully\\r\\nand wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he thanked her kindly\\r\\nand oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he was not a\\r\\nWizard the people were proud of him. “For,” they said, “there\\r\\nis not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.”\\r\\nAnd, so far as they knew, they were quite right.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met in\\r\\nthe Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throne\\r\\nand the others stood respectfully before him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palace\\r\\nand the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When I\\r\\nremember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer’s\\r\\ncornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quite\\r\\nsatisfied with my lot.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my new\\r\\nheart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast that\\r\\never lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,”\\r\\ncontinued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I don’t want to live here,” cried Dorothy. “I want\\r\\nto go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins and\\r\\nneedles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\\r\\ndesert?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully. “It’s\\r\\njust the thing. I’ll go at once for the Golden Cap.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soon\\r\\nthe band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood beside\\r\\nher.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King,\\r\\nbowing before the little girl. “What do you wish?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That cannot be done,” he said. “We belong to this country\\r\\nalone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\\r\\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don’t belong there. We shall\\r\\nbe glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert.\\r\\nGood-bye.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away through\\r\\nthe window, followed by all his band.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. “I have wasted the charm of\\r\\nthe Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeys\\r\\ncannot help me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly that\\r\\nDorothy feared it would burst.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said,\\r\\n“and ask his advice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Oz\\r\\nwas alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier,\\r\\n“wishes to cross the desert. How can she do so?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has ever\\r\\ncrossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Glinda might,” he suggested.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches, and\\r\\nrules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert,\\r\\nso she may know a way to cross it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and she\\r\\nis kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\\r\\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it is\\r\\nsaid to be full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods,\\r\\nand a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\\r\\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is to\\r\\ntravel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of course, if\\r\\nDorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tired\\r\\nof your city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\\r\\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” agreed the Woodman. “My axe may be of service\\r\\nto her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have had\\r\\nbrains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\\r\\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave her\\r\\nuntil she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully. “You are all very kind\\r\\nto me. But I should like to start as soon as possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “So\\r\\nnow let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XIX\\r\\nAttacked by the Fighting Trees\\n\\r\\nThe next morning Dorothy kissed the pretty green girl good-bye, and they all\\r\\nshook hands with the soldier with the green whiskers, who had walked with them\\r\\nas far as the gate. When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wondered\\r\\ngreatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. But\\r\\nhe at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, and\\r\\ngave them many good wishes to carry with them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so you\\r\\nmust come back to us as soon as possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “but\\r\\nI must help Dorothy to get home, first.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone has\\r\\nbeen good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like to\\r\\nkeep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you will\\r\\nfind a way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walked\\r\\nforth and started upon their journey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of the\\r\\nSouth. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together.\\r\\nDorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrow\\r\\nand the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffed\\r\\nthe fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joy\\r\\nat being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the moths\\r\\nand butterflies, barking merrily all the time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, as\\r\\nthey walked along at a brisk pace. “I have lost much flesh since I lived\\r\\nthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts how\\r\\ncourageous I have grown.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they could see\\r\\nwas a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up above\\r\\neverything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, as\\r\\nhe felt his heart rattling around in his breast.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added the\\r\\nLion, “he would have been a brave man.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had done\\r\\nhis best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man, even if he was a\\r\\nbad Wizard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowers\\r\\nthat stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night on\\r\\nthe grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very well\\r\\nindeed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was no\\r\\nway of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far as\\r\\nthey could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of their\\r\\njourney for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it would\\r\\nbe easiest to get into the forest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with such\\r\\nwide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath.\\r\\nSo he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branches\\r\\nthey bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised from\\r\\nthe ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked rather\\r\\ndizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for it\\r\\ndoesn’t hurt me to get thrown about.” He walked up to another tree,\\r\\nas he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall we\\r\\ndo?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\\r\\njourney,” remarked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shouldering\\r\\nhis axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\\r\\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it so\\r\\nfiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branches\\r\\nas if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” They\\r\\nall ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was\\r\\ncaught by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\\r\\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made up\\r\\ntheir minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches,\\r\\nand that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given this\\r\\nwonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to the\\r\\nfarther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them a\\r\\nhigh wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like the\\r\\nsurface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for we\\r\\ncertainly must climb over the wall.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XX\\r\\nThe Dainty China Country\\n\\r\\nWhile the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest\\r\\nDorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk. The Lion also\\r\\ncurled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied the\\r\\nWoodman. “When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on the\\r\\nother side.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was\\r\\nsure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothy\\r\\nand the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready. The Scarecrow\\r\\nclimbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow\\r\\nclose behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his head over the top\\r\\nof the wall the Scarecrow said, “Oh, my!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, and\\r\\nDorothy put her head over and cried, “Oh, my!” just as the\\r\\nScarecrow had done.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him be\\r\\nstill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both of\\r\\nthem cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall. When\\r\\nthey were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and saw\\r\\na strange sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBefore them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shining\\r\\nand white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were many houses\\r\\nmade entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses were\\r\\nquite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy’s\\r\\nwaist. There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and\\r\\nmany cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were\\r\\nstanding about in groups.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. There\\r\\nwere milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden\\r\\nspots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver\\r\\nand gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and\\r\\nyellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and\\r\\nprinces with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin\\r\\ndoublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their\\r\\ncheeks and tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were all\\r\\nmade of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest of\\r\\nthem was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple\\r\\nchina dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them\\r\\nin a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell\\r\\noff the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would\\r\\nnot hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get\\r\\nthe pins in their feet. When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow,\\r\\nwhose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other\\r\\nside,” said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any other\\r\\nway except due South.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing\\r\\nthey came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, the\\r\\ncow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the\\r\\nmilkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that the\\r\\npail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick in\\r\\nher left elbow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done!\\r\\nMy cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop and\\r\\nhave it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\\r\\ncow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgive\\r\\nus.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She picked up\\r\\nthe leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As\\r\\nshe left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at\\r\\nthe clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman,\\r\\n“or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get over\\r\\nit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, who\\r\\nstopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But the china\\r\\ngirl cried out:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\\r\\n“Why not?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance\\r\\naway, “if I run I may fall down and break myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,”\\r\\nreplied the Princess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the china\\r\\nlady, “who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself\\r\\nso often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at all\\r\\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could see\\r\\nthat in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he was\\r\\ncompletely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainly\\r\\nthat he had been mended in many places.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks and\\r\\nnodding his head at them saucily, he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“My lady fair,\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Why do you stare\\r\\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0You’re quite as stiff\\r\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0And prim as if\\r\\nYou’d eaten up a poker!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess. “Can’t you see\\r\\nthese are strangers, and should be treated with respect?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, and\\r\\nimmediately stood upon his head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mind Mr. Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy.\\r\\n“He is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes him\\r\\nfoolish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But you\\r\\nare so beautiful,” she continued, “that I am sure I could love you\\r\\ndearly. Won’t you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt\\r\\nEm’s mantel? I could carry you in my basket.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess.\\r\\n“You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\\r\\naround as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at once\\r\\nstiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that is all\\r\\nthat is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-room\\r\\ntables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimed\\r\\nDorothy. “So I’ll just say good-bye.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and all the\\r\\npeople scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, and\\r\\nafter an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country and\\r\\ncame to another china wall.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion’s\\r\\nback they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion gathered his legs\\r\\nunder him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a china\\r\\nchurch with his tail and smashed it all to pieces.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we were\\r\\nlucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’s\\r\\nleg and a church. They are all so brittle!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful I\\r\\nam made of straw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in the\\r\\nworld than being a Scarecrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXI\\r\\nThe Lion Becomes the King of Beasts\\n\\r\\nAfter climbing down from the china wall the travelers found themselves in a\\r\\ndisagreeable country, full of bogs and marshes and covered with tall, rank\\r\\ngrass. It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grass\\r\\nwas so thick that it hid them from sight. However, by carefully picking their\\r\\nway, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here the\\r\\ncountry seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through the\\r\\nunderbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and older\\r\\nthan any they had ever seen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, looking\\r\\naround him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to live\\r\\nhere all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and how\\r\\nrich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beast\\r\\ncould wish a pleasanter home.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not see\\r\\nany of them about.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther.\\r\\nDorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow kept watch over them as usual.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they heard a\\r\\nlow rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto whimpered a little,\\r\\nbut none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-trodden\\r\\npath until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundreds\\r\\nof beasts of every variety. There were tigers and elephants and bears and\\r\\nwolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a moment\\r\\nDorothy was afraid. But the Lion explained that the animals were holding a\\r\\nmeeting, and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in great\\r\\ntrouble.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the great\\r\\nassemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lion\\r\\nand bowed, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemy\\r\\nand bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierce\\r\\nenemy which has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster,\\r\\nlike a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as a\\r\\ntree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls through\\r\\nthe forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where he\\r\\neats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fierce\\r\\ncreature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care of\\r\\nourselves when you came among us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion thought for a moment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides,\\r\\nthey were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me as\\r\\nKing of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the other\\r\\nbeasts roared with a mighty roar: “We will!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with his\\r\\nforefoot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion,\\r\\n“and I will go at once to fight the monster.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with the\\r\\nenemy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked so\\r\\nugly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long as\\r\\nthe tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair. It had a great\\r\\nmouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to the\\r\\npudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion a\\r\\nhint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier to\\r\\nfight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon the\\r\\nmonster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed with\\r\\nsharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down, he\\r\\nwatched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quite\\r\\ndead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waiting\\r\\nfor him and said proudly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You need fear your enemy no longer.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised to come\\r\\nback and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXII\\r\\nThe Country of the Quadlings\\n\\r\\nThe four travelers passed through the rest of the forest in safety, and when\\r\\nthey came out from its gloom saw before them a steep hill, covered from top to\\r\\nbottom with great pieces of rock.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will be a hard climb,” said the Scarecrow, “but we must\\r\\nget over the hill, nevertheless.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he led the way and the others followed. They had nearly reached the first\\r\\nrock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “This\\r\\nhill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow. “We’re\\r\\ngoing to the country of the Quadlings.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped from\\r\\nbehind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top and\\r\\nsupported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms at all, and,\\r\\nseeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature could\\r\\nprevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, “I’m sorry not to\\r\\ndo as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it or\\r\\nnot,” and he walked boldly forward.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck stretched\\r\\nout until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in the\\r\\nmiddle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the hill. Almost as quickly\\r\\nas it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as he\\r\\nsaid, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy saw\\r\\nhundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’s\\r\\nmishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up the hill.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the hill as\\r\\nif he had been struck by a cannon ball.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion came up to\\r\\nher, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is useless to fight\\r\\npeople with shooting heads; no one can withstand them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can we do, then?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “You\\r\\nhave still the right to command them once more.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap she\\r\\nuttered the magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a few\\r\\nmoments the entire band stood before her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowing\\r\\nlow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answered\\r\\nthe girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeys\\r\\ncaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them. As\\r\\nthey passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot their\\r\\nheads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, which\\r\\ncarried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in the\\r\\nbeautiful country of the Quadlings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader to\\r\\nDorothy; “so good-bye and good luck to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and the\\r\\nMonkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field upon field\\r\\nof ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty rippling\\r\\nbrooks with strong bridges across them. The fences and houses and bridges were\\r\\nall painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country of\\r\\nthe Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves,\\r\\nwho were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all in\\r\\nred, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walked\\r\\nup to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer’s wife, and\\r\\nwhen Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner,\\r\\nwith three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk for\\r\\nToto.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife.\\r\\n“Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields and\\r\\nacross the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle.\\r\\nBefore the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniforms\\r\\ntrimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached, one of them said to her:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why have you come to the South Country?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered. “Will\\r\\nyou take me to her?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receive\\r\\nyou.” They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.\\r\\nAfter a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to be\\r\\nadmitted at once.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIII\\r\\nGlinda The Good Witch Grants Dorothy’s Wish\\n\\r\\nBefore they went to see Glinda, however, they were taken to a room of the\\r\\nCastle, where Dorothy washed her face and combed her hair, and the Lion shook\\r\\nthe dust out of his mane, and the Scarecrow patted himself into his best shape,\\r\\nand the Woodman polished his tin and oiled his joints.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they were all quite presentable they followed the soldier girl into a big\\r\\nroom where the Witch Glinda sat upon a throne of rubies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe was both beautiful and young to their eyes. Her hair was a rich red in\\r\\ncolor and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was pure white\\r\\nbut her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to the\\r\\nLand of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventures\\r\\nthey had met with.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas,\\r\\nfor Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and that\\r\\nwill make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year than\\r\\nthey were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving little\\r\\ngirl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell you\\r\\nof a way to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, you\\r\\nmust give me the Golden Cap.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use to\\r\\nme now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys three\\r\\ntimes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,”\\r\\nanswered Glinda, smiling.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow,\\r\\n“What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz has\\r\\nmade me its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is how\\r\\nto cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carry\\r\\nyou to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it would\\r\\nbe a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are unusual,” replied Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTurning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you when\\r\\nDorothy leaves this country?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, “The Winkies\\r\\nwere very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witch\\r\\ndied. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country of\\r\\nthe West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “will\\r\\nbe that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not be\\r\\nso large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter than\\r\\nhe is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will rule the\\r\\nWinkies wisely and well.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothy\\r\\nhas returned to her own home, what will become of you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies a\\r\\ngrand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King.\\r\\nIf I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happily\\r\\nthere.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shall\\r\\nbe to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the Golden\\r\\nCap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band may\\r\\nthereafter be free for evermore.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witch\\r\\nearnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yet\\r\\ntold me how to get back to Kansas.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda.\\r\\n“If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Em\\r\\nthe very first day you came to this country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried the\\r\\nScarecrow. “I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’s\\r\\ncornfield.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n“I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of the\\r\\nworld.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion,\\r\\n“and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say to\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of use\\r\\nto these good friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired,\\r\\nand each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like to\\r\\ngo back to Kansas.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderful\\r\\npowers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carry\\r\\nyou to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in the\\r\\nwink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three times\\r\\nand command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them to\\r\\ncarry me back to Kansas at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his big\\r\\nhead tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way most\\r\\ndangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrow\\r\\nin her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was crying\\r\\nherself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl a\\r\\ngood-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown to\\r\\nher friends and herself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one last\\r\\ngood-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Take me home to Aunt Em!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nInstantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could see\\r\\nor feel was the wind whistling past her ears.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly that\\r\\nshe rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length, however, she sat up and looked about her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good gracious!” she cried.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was the\\r\\nnew farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one.\\r\\nUncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out of\\r\\nher arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver Shoes\\r\\nhad fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the\\r\\ndesert.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XXIV\\r\\nHome Again\\n\\r\\nAunt Em had just come out of the house to water the cabbages when she looked up\\r\\nand saw Dorothy running toward her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My darling child!” she cried, folding the little girl in her arms\\r\\nand covering her face with kisses. “Where in the world did you come\\r\\nfrom?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“From the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy gravely. “And here is\\r\\nToto, too. And oh, Aunt Em! I’m so glad to be at home again!”\\r\\n\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ ***\\nThis file should be named 55-h.htm or 55-h.zip\\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in https://www.gutenberg.org/5/55/\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

At first I considered these little letters, frank and\\r\\nearnest though they were, in the light of pretty compliments; but the letters\\r\\ncontinued to come during succeeding months, and even years.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally I promised one little girl, who made a long journey to see me and\\r\\nprefer her request,—and she is a “Dorothy,” by the\\r\\nway—that when a thousand little girls had written me a thousand little\\r\\nletters asking for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman I would write the book,\\r\\nEither little Dorothy was a fairy in disguise, and waved her magic wand, or the\\r\\nsuccess of the stage production of “The Wizard of OZ” made new\\r\\nfriends for the story, For the thousand letters reached their destination long\\r\\nsince—and many more followed them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, although pleading guilty to long delay, I have kept my promise in this\\r\\nbook.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nL.

There was more to his name than that, for old Mombi often\\r\\ndeclared that his whole name was Tippetarius; but no one was expected to say\\r\\nsuch a long word when “Tip” would do just as well.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis boy remembered nothing of his parents, for he had been brought when quite\\r\\nyoung to be reared by the old woman known as Mombi, whose reputation, I am\\r\\nsorry to say, was none of the best. For the Gillikin people had reason to\\r\\nsuspect her of indulging in magical arts, and therefore hesitated to associate\\r\\nwith her.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi was not exactly a Witch, because the Good Witch who ruled that part of\\r\\nthe Land of Oz had forbidden any other Witch to exist in her dominions. So\\r\\nTip’s guardian, however much she might aspire to working magic, realized\\r\\nit was unlawful to be more than a Sorceress, or at most a Wizardess.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip was made to carry wood from the forest, that the old woman might boil her\\r\\npot. He also worked in the corn-fields, hoeing and husking; and he fed the pigs\\r\\nand milked the four-horned cow that was Mombi’s especial pride.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut you must not suppose he worked all the time, for he felt that would be bad\\r\\nfor him. When sent to the forest Tip often climbed trees for birds’ eggs\\r\\nor amused himself chasing the fleet white rabbits or fishing in the brooks with\\r\\nbent pins. Then he would hastily gather his armful of wood and carry it home.\\r\\nAnd when he was supposed to be working in the corn-fields, and the tall stalks\\r\\nhid him from Mombi’s view, Tip would often dig in the gopher holes, or if\\r\\nthe mood seized him—lie upon his back between the rows of corn and take a\\r\\nnap. So, by taking care not to exhaust his strength, he grew as strong and\\r\\nrugged as a boy may be.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi’s curious magic often frightened her neighbors, and they treated\\r\\nher shyly, yet respectfully, because of her weird powers. But Tip frankly hated\\r\\nher, and took no pains to hide his feelings. Indeed, he sometimes showed less\\r\\nrespect for the old woman than he should have done, considering she was his\\r\\nguardian.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere were pumpkins in Mombi’s corn-fields, lying golden red among the\\r\\nrows of green stalks; and these had been planted and carefully tended that the\\r\\nfour-horned cow might eat of them in the winter time. But one day, after the\\r\\ncorn had all been cut and stacked, and Tip was carrying the pumpkins to the\\r\\nstable, he took a notion to make a “Jack Lantern” and try to give\\r\\nthe old woman a fright with it.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he selected a fine, big pumpkin—one with a lustrous, orange-red\\r\\ncolor—and began carving it. With the point of his knife he made two round\\r\\neyes, a three-cornered nose, and a mouth shaped like a new moon. The face, when\\r\\ncompleted, could not have been considered strictly beautiful; but it wore a\\r\\nsmile so big and broad, and was so Jolly in expression, that even Tip laughed\\r\\nas he looked admiringly at his work.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe child had no playmates, so he did not know that boys often dig out the\\r\\ninside of a “pumpkin-jack,” and in the space thus made put a\\r\\nlighted candle to render the face more startling; but he conceived an idea of\\r\\nhis own that promised to be quite as effective. He decided to manufacture the\\r\\nform of a man, who would wear this pumpkin head, and to stand it in a place\\r\\nwhere old Mombi would meet it face to face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And then,” said Tip to himself, with a laugh, “she’ll\\r\\nsqueal louder than the brown pig does when I pull her tail, and shiver with\\r\\nfright worse than I did last year when I had the ague!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe had plenty of time to accomplish this task, for Mombi had gone to a\\r\\nvillage—to buy groceries, she said—and it was a journey of at least\\r\\ntwo days.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he took his axe to the forest, and selected some stout, straight saplings,\\r\\nwhich he cut down and trimmed of all their twigs and leaves. From these he\\r\\nwould make the arms, and legs, and feet of his man. For the body he stripped a\\r\\nsheet of thick bark from around a big tree, and with much labor fashioned it\\r\\ninto a cylinder of about the right size, pinning the edges together with wooden\\r\\npegs. Then, whistling happily as he worked, he carefully jointed the limbs and\\r\\nfastened them to the body with pegs whittled into shape with his knife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the time this feat had been accomplished it began to grow dark, and Tip\\r\\nremembered he must milk the cow and feed the pigs. So he picked up his wooden\\r\\nman and carried it back to the house with him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDuring the evening, by the light of the fire in the kitchen, Tip carefully\\r\\nrounded all the edges of the joints and smoothed the rough places in a neat and\\r\\nworkmanlike manner. Then he stood the figure up against the wall and admired\\r\\nit. It seemed remarkably tall, even for a full-grown man; but that was a good\\r\\npoint in a small boy’s eyes, and Tip did not object at all to the size of\\r\\nhis creation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNext morning, when he looked at his work again, Tip saw he had forgotten to\\r\\ngive the dummy a neck, by means of which he might fasten the pumpkinhead to the\\r\\nbody. So he went again to the forest, which was not far away, and chopped from\\r\\na tree several pieces of wood with which to complete his work. When he returned\\r\\nhe fastened a cross-piece to the upper end of the body, making a hole through\\r\\nthe center to hold upright the neck. The bit of wood which formed this neck was\\r\\nalso sharpened at the upper end, and when all was ready Tip put on the pumpkin\\r\\nhead, pressing it well down onto the neck, and found that it fitted very well.\\r\\nThe head could be turned to one side or the other, as he pleased, and the\\r\\nhinges of the arms and legs allowed him to place the dummy in any position he\\r\\ndesired.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, that,” declared Tip, proudly, “is really a very fine\\r\\nman, and it ought to frighten several screeches out of old Mombi! But it would\\r\\nbe much more lifelike if it were properly dressed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTo find clothing seemed no easy task; but Tip boldly ransacked the great chest\\r\\nin which Mombi kept all her keepsakes and treasures, and at the very bottom he\\r\\ndiscovered some purple trousers, a red shirt and a pink vest which was dotted\\r\\nwith white spots. These he carried away to his man and succeeded, although the\\r\\ngarments did not fit very well, in dressing the creature in a jaunty fashion.\\r\\nSome knit stockings belonging to Mombi and a much worn pair of his own shoes\\r\\ncompleted the man’s apparel, and Tip was so delighted that he danced up\\r\\nand down and laughed aloud in boyish ecstacy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must give him a name!” he cried. “So good a man as this\\r\\nmust surely have a name. I believe,” he added, after a moment’s\\r\\nthought, “I will name the fellow ‘Jack Pumpkinhead!’”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Marvelous Powder of Life\\n\\r\\nAfter considering the matter carefully, Tip decided that the best place to\\r\\nlocate Jack would be at the bend in the road, a little way from the house. So\\r\\nhe started to carry his man there, but found him heavy and rather awkward to\\r\\nhandle. After dragging the creature a short distance Tip stood him on his feet,\\r\\nand by first bending the joints of one leg, and then those of the other, at the\\r\\nsame time pushing from behind, the boy managed to induce Jack to walk to the\\r\\nbend in the road. It was not accomplished without a few tumbles, and Tip really\\r\\nworked harder than he ever had in the fields or forest; but a love of mischief\\r\\nurged him on, and it pleased him to test the cleverness of his workmanship.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Jack’s all right, and works fine!” he said to himself,\\r\\npanting with the unusual exertion. But just then he discovered the man’s\\r\\nleft arm had fallen off in the journey so he went back to find it, and\\r\\nafterward, by whittling a new and stouter pin for the shoulder-joint, he\\r\\nrepaired the injury so successfully that the arm was stronger than before. Tip\\r\\nalso noticed that Jack’s pumpkin head had twisted around until it faced\\r\\nhis back; but this was easily remedied. When, at last, the man was set up\\r\\nfacing the turn in the path where old Mombi was to appear, he looked natural\\r\\nenough to be a fair imitation of a Gillikin farmer,—and unnatural enough\\r\\nto startle anyone that came on him unawares.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs it was yet too early in the day to expect the old woman to return home, Tip\\r\\nwent down into the valley below the farm-house and began to gather nuts from\\r\\nthe trees that grew there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever, old Mombi returned earlier than usual. She had met a crooked wizard\\r\\nwho resided in a lonely cave in the mountains, and had traded several important\\r\\nsecrets of magic with him. Having in this way secured three new recipes, four\\r\\nmagical powders and a selection of herbs of wonderful power and potency, she\\r\\nhobbled home as fast as she could, in order to test her new sorceries.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo intent was Mombi on the treasures she had gained that when she turned the\\r\\nbend in the road and caught a glimpse of the man, she merely nodded and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good evening, sir.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut, a moment after, noting that the person did not move or reply, she cast a\\r\\nshrewd glance into his face and discovered his pumpkin head elaborately carved\\r\\nby Tip’s jack-knife.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Heh!” ejaculated Mombi, giving a sort of grunt; “that\\r\\nrascally boy has been playing tricks again! Very good! ve—ry good!\\r\\nI’ll beat him black-and-blue for trying to scare me in this\\r\\nfashion!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAngrily she raised her stick to smash in the grinning pumpkin head of the\\r\\ndummy; but a sudden thought made her pause, the uplifted stick left motionless\\r\\nin the air.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, here is a good chance to try my new powder!” said she,\\r\\neagerly. “And then I can tell whether that crooked wizard has fairly\\r\\ntraded secrets, or whether he has fooled me as wickedly as I fooled him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo she set down her basket and began fumbling in it for one of the precious\\r\\npowders she had obtained.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile Mombi was thus occupied Tip strolled back, with his pockets full of nuts,\\r\\nand discovered the old woman standing beside his man and apparently not the\\r\\nleast bit frightened by it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt first he was generally disappointed; but the next moment he became curious\\r\\nto know what Mombi was going to do. So he hid behind a hedge, where he could\\r\\nsee without being seen, and prepared to watch.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter some search the woman drew from her basket an old pepper-box, upon the\\r\\nfaded label of which the wizard had written with a lead-pencil:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Powder of Life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah—here it is!” she cried, joyfully. “And now let us\\r\\nsee if it is potent. The stingy wizard didn’t give me much of it, but I\\r\\nguess there’s enough for two or three doses.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTip was much surprised when he overheard this speech. Then he saw old Mombi\\r\\nraise her arm and sprinkle the powder from the box over the pumpkin head of his\\r\\nman Jack. She did this in the same way one would pepper a baked potato, and the\\r\\npowder sifted down from Jack’s head and scattered over the red shirt and\\r\\npink waistcoat and purple trousers Tip had dressed him in, and a portion even\\r\\nfell upon the patched and worn shoes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, putting the pepper-box back into the basket, Mombi lifted her left hand,\\r\\nwith its little finger pointed upward, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Weaugh!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she lifted her right hand, with the thumb pointed upward, and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Teaugh!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she lifted both hands, with all the fingers and thumbs spread out, and\\r\\ncried:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Peaugh!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack Pumpkinhead stepped back a pace, at this, and said in a reproachful voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t yell like that! Do you think I’m deaf?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOld Mombi danced around him, frantic with delight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He lives!” she screamed: “He lives! he lives!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she threw her stick into the air and caught it as it came down; and she\\r\\nhugged herself with both arms, and tried to do a step of a jig; and all the\\r\\ntime she repeated, rapturously:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He lives!—he lives!—he lives!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow you may well suppose that Tip observed all this with amazement.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt first he was so frightened and horrified that he wanted to run away, but his\\r\\nlegs trembled and shook so badly that he couldn’t. Then it struck him as\\r\\na very funny thing for Jack to come to life, especially as the expression on\\r\\nhis pumpkin face was so droll and comical it excited laughter on the instant.\\r\\nSo, recovering from his first fear, Tip began to laugh; and the merry peals\\r\\nreached old Mombi’s ears and made her hobble quickly to the hedge, where\\r\\nshe seized Tip’s collar and dragged him back to where she had left her\\r\\nbasket and the pumpkinheaded man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You naughty, sneaking, wicked boy!” she exclaimed, furiously:\\r\\n“I’ll teach you to spy out my secrets and to make fun of me!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wasn’t making fun of you,” protested Tip. “I was\\r\\nlaughing at old Pumpkinhead! Look at him! Isn’t he a picture,\\r\\nthough?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope you are not reflecting on my personal appearance,” said\\r\\nJack; and it was so funny to hear his grave voice, while his face continued to\\r\\nwear its jolly smile, that Tip again burst into a peal of laughter.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nEven Mombi was not without a curious interest in the man her magic had brought\\r\\nto life; for, after staring at him intently, she presently asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What do you know?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, that is hard to tell,” replied Jack. “For although I\\r\\nfeel that I know a tremendous lot, I am not yet aware how much there is in the\\r\\nworld to find out about. It will take me a little time to discover whether I am\\r\\nvery wise or very foolish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure,” said Mombi, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what are you going to do with him, now he is alive?” asked\\r\\nTip, wondering.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must think it over,” answered Mombi. “But we must get home\\r\\nat once, for it is growing dark. Help the Pumpkinhead to walk.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind me,” said Jack; “I can walk as well as you can.\\r\\nHaven’t I got legs and feet, and aren’t they jointed?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are they?” asked the woman, turning to Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course they are; I made ’em myself,” returned the boy,\\r\\nwith pride.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they started for the house, but when they reached the farm yard old Mombi\\r\\nled the pumpkin man to the cow stable and shut him up in an empty stall,\\r\\nfastening the door securely on the outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve got to attend to you, first,” she said, nodding her\\r\\nhead at Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHearing this, the boy became uneasy; for he knew Mombi had a bad and revengeful\\r\\nheart, and would not hesitate to do any evil thing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey entered the house. It was a round, domeshaped structure, as are nearly all\\r\\nthe farm houses in the Land of Oz.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi bade the boy light a candle, while she put her basket in a cupboard and\\r\\nhung her cloak on a peg. Tip obeyed quickly, for he was afraid of her.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter the candle had been lighted Mombi ordered him to build a fire in the\\r\\nhearth, and while Tip was thus engaged the old woman ate her supper. When the\\r\\nflames began to crackle the boy came to her and asked a share of the bread and\\r\\ncheese; but Mombi refused him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m hungry!” said Tip, in a sulky tone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You won’t be hungry long,” replied Mombi, with a grim look.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe boy didn’t like this speech, for it sounded like a threat; but he\\r\\nhappened to remember he had nuts in his pocket, so he cracked some of those and\\r\\nate them while the woman rose, shook the crumbs from her apron, and hung above\\r\\nthe fire a small black kettle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen she measured out equal parts of milk and vinegar and poured them into the\\r\\nkettle. Next she produced several packets of herbs and powders and began adding\\r\\na portion of each to the contents of the kettle. Occasionally she would draw\\r\\nnear the candle and read from a yellow paper the recipe of the mess she was\\r\\nconcocting.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs Tip watched her his uneasiness increased.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is that for?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For you,” returned Mombi, briefly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip wriggled around upon his stool and stared awhile at the kettle, which was\\r\\nbeginning to bubble. Then he would glance at the stern and wrinkled features of\\r\\nthe witch and wish he were any place but in that dim and smoky kitchen, where\\r\\neven the shadows cast by the candle upon the wall were enough to give one the\\r\\nhorrors. So an hour passed away, during which the silence was only broken by\\r\\nthe bubbling of the pot and the hissing of the flames.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally, Tip spoke again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have I got to drink that stuff?” he asked, nodding toward the pot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Mombi.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What’ll it do to me?” asked Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If it’s properly made,” replied Mombi, “it will change\\r\\nor transform you into a marble statue.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip groaned, and wiped the perspiration from his forehead with his sleeve.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t want to be a marble statue!” he protested.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“That doesn’t matter I want you to be one,” said the old\\r\\nwoman, looking at him severely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What use’ll I be then?” asked Tip. “There won’t\\r\\nbe any one to work for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll make the Pumpkinhead work for me,” said Mombi.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain Tip groaned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you change me into a goat, or a chicken?” he\\r\\nasked, anxiously. “You can’t do anything with a marble\\r\\nstatue.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes, I can,” returned Mombi. “I’m going to plant a\\r\\nflower garden, next Spring, and I’ll put you in the middle of it, for an\\r\\nornament. I wonder I haven’t thought of that before; you’ve been a\\r\\nbother to me for years.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this terrible speech Tip felt the beads of perspiration starting all over\\r\\nhis body, but he sat still and shivered and looked anxiously at the kettle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it won’t work,” he mutttered, in a voice that\\r\\nsounded weak and discouraged.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I think it will,” answered Mombi, cheerfully. “I seldom\\r\\nmake a mistake.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain there was a period of silence a silence so long and gloomy that when\\r\\nMombi finally lifted the kettle from the fire it was close to midnight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You cannot drink it until it has become quite cold,” announced the\\r\\nold witch for in spite of the law she had acknowledged practising witchcraft.\\r\\n“We must both go to bed now, and at daybreak I will call you and at once\\r\\ncomplete your transformation into a marble statue.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this she hobbled into her room, bearing the steaming kettle with her, and\\r\\nTip heard her close and lock the door.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe boy did not go to bed, as he had been commanded to do, but still sat\\r\\nglaring at the embers of the dying fire.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Flight of the Fugitives\\n\\r\\nTip reflected.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s a hard thing, to be a marble statue,” he thought,\\r\\nrebelliously, “and I’m not going to stand it. For years I’ve\\r\\nbeen a bother to her, she says; so she’s going to get rid of me. Well,\\r\\nthere’s an easier way than to become a statue. No boy could have any fun\\r\\nforever standing in the middle of a flower garden! I’ll run away,\\r\\nthat’s what I’ll do—and I may as well go before she makes me\\r\\ndrink that nasty stuff in the kettle.” He waited until the snores of the\\r\\nold witch announced she was fast asleep, and then he arose softly and went to\\r\\nthe cupboard to find something to eat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No use starting on a journey without food,” he decided, searching\\r\\nupon the narrow shelves.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe found some crusts of bread; but he had to look into Mombi’s basket to\\r\\nfind the cheese she had brought from the village. While turning over the\\r\\ncontents of the basket he came upon the pepper-box which contained the\\r\\n“Powder of Life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I may as well take this with me,” he thought, “or\\r\\nMombi’ll be using it to make more mischief with.” So he put the box\\r\\nin his pocket, together with the bread and cheese.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he cautiously left the house and latched the door behind him. Outside both\\r\\nmoon and stars shone brightly, and the night seemed peaceful and inviting after\\r\\nthe close and ill-smelling kitchen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll be glad to get away,” said Tip, softly; “for I\\r\\nnever did like that old woman. I wonder how I ever came to live with\\r\\nher.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was walking slowly toward the road when a thought made him pause.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t like to leave Jack Pumpkinhead to the tender mercies of\\r\\nold Mombi,” he muttered. “And Jack belongs to me, for I made him\\r\\neven if the old witch did bring him to life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe retraced his steps to the cow-stable and opened the door of the stall where\\r\\nthe pumpkin-headed man had been left.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack was standing in the middle of the stall, and by the moonlight Tip could\\r\\nsee he was smiling just as jovially as ever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come on!” said the boy, beckoning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where to?” asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’ll know as soon as I do,” answered Tip, smiling\\r\\nsympathetically into the pumpkin face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All we’ve got to do now is to tramp.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” returned Jack, and walked awkwardly out of the stable\\r\\nand into the moonlight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip turned toward the road and the man followed him. Jack walked with a sort of\\r\\nlimp, and occasionally one of the joints of his legs would turn backward,\\r\\ninstead of frontwise, almost causing him to tumble. But the Pumpkinhead was\\r\\nquick to notice this, and began to take more pains to step carefully; so that\\r\\nhe met with few accidents.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTip led him along the path without stopping an instant. They could not go very\\r\\nfast, but they walked steadily; and by the time the moon sank away and the sun\\r\\npeeped over the hills they had travelled so great a distance that the boy had\\r\\nno reason to fear pursuit from the old witch. Moreover, he had turned first\\r\\ninto one path, and then into another, so that should anyone follow them it\\r\\nwould prove very difficult to guess which way they had gone, or where to seek\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFairly satisfied that he had escaped—for a time, at least—being\\r\\nturned into a marble statue, the boy stopped his companion and seated himself\\r\\nupon a rock by the roadside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let’s have some breakfast,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack Pumpkinhead watched Tip curiously, but refused to join in the repast.\\r\\n“I don’t seem to be made the same way you are,” he said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know you are not,” returned Tip; “for I made you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh! Did you?” asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly. And put you together. And carved your eyes and nose and ears\\r\\nand mouth,” said Tip proudly. “And dressed you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack looked at his body and limbs critically.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It strikes me you made a very good job of it,” he remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Just so-so,” replied Tip, modestly; for he began to see certain\\r\\ndefects in the construction of his man. “If I’d known we were going\\r\\nto travel together I might have been a little more particular.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, then,” said the Pumpkinhead, in a tone that expressed\\r\\nsurprise, “you must be my creator my parent my father!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or your inventor,” replied the boy with a laugh. “Yes, my\\r\\nson; I really believe I am!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I owe you obedience,” continued the man, “and you owe\\r\\nme—support.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s it, exactly”, declared Tip, jumping up. “So let\\r\\nus be off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where are we going?” asked Jack, when they had resumed their\\r\\njourney.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m not exactly sure,” said the boy; “but I believe we\\r\\nare headed South, and that will bring us, sooner or later, to the Emerald\\r\\nCity.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What city is that?” enquired the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s the center of the Land of Oz, and the biggest town in\\r\\nall the country. I’ve never been there, myself, but I’ve heard all\\r\\nabout its history. It was built by a mighty and wonderful Wizard named Oz, and\\r\\neverything there is of a green color—just as everything in this Country\\r\\nof the Gillikins is of a purple color.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is everything here purple?” asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course it is. Can’t you see?” returned the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe I must be color-blind,” said the Pumpkinhead, after\\r\\nstaring about him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, the grass is purple, and the trees are purple, and the houses and\\r\\nfences are purple,” explained Tip. “Even the mud in the roads is\\r\\npurple. But in the Emerald City everything is green that is purple here. And in\\r\\nthe Country of the Munchkins, over at the East, everything is blue; and in the\\r\\nSouth country of the Quadlings everything is red; and in the West country of\\r\\nthe Winkies, where the Tin Woodman rules, everything is yellow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” said Jack. Then, after a pause, he asked: “Did you say\\r\\na Tin Woodman rules the Winkies?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; he was one of those who helped Dorothy to destroy the Wicked Witch\\r\\nof the West, and the Winkies were so grateful that they invited him to become\\r\\ntheir ruler,—just as the people of the Emerald City invited the Scarecrow\\r\\nto rule them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear me!” said Jack. “I’m getting confused with all\\r\\nthis history. Who is the Scarecrow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Another friend of Dorothy’s,” replied Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And who is Dorothy?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She was a girl that came here from Kansas, a place in the big, outside\\r\\nWorld. She got blown to the Land of Oz by a cyclone, and while she was here the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman accompanied her on her travels.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And where is she now?” inquired the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Glinda the Good, who rules the Quadlings, sent her home again,”\\r\\nsaid the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh. And what became of the Scarecrow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I told you. He rules the Emerald City,” answered Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought you said it was ruled by a wonderful Wizard,” objected\\r\\nJack, seeming more and more confused.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, so I did. Now, pay attention, and I’ll explain it,”\\r\\nsaid Tip, speaking slowly and looking the smiling Pumpkinhead squarely in the\\r\\neye. “Dorothy went to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard to send her back\\r\\nto Kansas; and the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman went with her. But the Wizard\\r\\ncouldn’t send her back, because he wasn’t so much of a Wizard as he\\r\\nmight have been. And then they got angry at the Wizard, and threatened to\\r\\nexpose him; so the Wizard made a big balloon and escaped in it, and no one has\\r\\never seen him since.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, that is very interesting history,” said Jack, well pleased;\\r\\n“and I understand it perfectly all but the explanation.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m glad you do,” responded Tip. “After the Wizard was\\r\\ngone, the people of the Emerald City made His Majesty, the Scarecrow, their\\r\\nKing; and I have heard that he became a very popular ruler.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are we going to see this queer King?” asked Jack, with interest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think we may as well,” replied the boy; “unless you have\\r\\nsomething better to do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, dear father,” said the Pumpkinhead. “I am quite\\r\\nwilling to go wherever you please.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTip Makes an Experiment in Magic\\n\\r\\nThe boy, small and rather delicate in appearance seemed somewhat embarrassed at\\r\\nbeing called “father” by the tall, awkward, pumpkinheaded man, but\\r\\nto deny the relationship would involve another long and tedious explanation; so\\r\\nhe changed the subject by asking, abruptly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you tired?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course not!” replied the other. “But,” he\\r\\ncontinued, after a pause, “it is quite certain I shall wear out my wooden\\r\\njoints if I keep on walking.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip reflected, as they journeyed on, that this was true. He began to regret\\r\\nthat he had not constructed the wooden limbs more carefully and substantially.\\r\\nYet how could he ever have guessed that the man he had made merely to scare old\\r\\nMombi with would be brought to life by means of a magical powder contained in\\r\\nan old pepper-box?\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he ceased to reproach himself, and began to think how he might yet remedy\\r\\nthe deficiencies of Jack’s weak joints.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged they came to the edge of a wood, and the boy sat down to\\r\\nrest upon an old sawhorse that some woodcutter had left there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you sit down?” he asked the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t it strain my joints?” inquired the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course not. It’ll rest them,” declared the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Jack tried to sit down; but as soon as he bent his joints farther than usual\\r\\nthey gave way altogether, and he came clattering to the ground with such a\\r\\ncrash that Tip feared he was entirely ruined.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nHe rushed to the man, lifted him to his feet, straightened his arms and legs,\\r\\nand felt of his head to see if by chance it had become cracked. But Jack seemed\\r\\nto be in pretty good shape, after all, and Tip said to him:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I guess you’d better remain standing, hereafter. It seems the\\r\\nsafest way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well, dear father.” just as you say, replied the smiling\\r\\nJack, who had been in no wise confused by his tumble.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip sat down again. Presently the Pumpkinhead asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is that thing you are sitting on?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, this is a horse,” replied the boy, carelessly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is a horse?” demanded Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A horse? Why, there are two kinds of horses,” returned Tip,\\r\\nslightly puzzled how to explain. “One kind of horse is alive, and has\\r\\nfour legs and a head and a tail. And people ride upon its back.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I understand,” said Jack, cheerfully “That’s the kind\\r\\nof horse you are now sitting on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, it isn’t,” answered Tip, promptly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not? That one has four legs, and a head, and a tail.” Tip\\r\\nlooked at the saw-horse more carefully, and found that the Pumpkinhead was\\r\\nright. The body had been formed from a tree-trunk, and a branch had been left\\r\\nsticking up at one end that looked very much like a tail. In the other end were\\r\\ntwo big knots that resembled eyes, and a place had been chopped away that might\\r\\neasily be mistaken for the horse’s mouth. As for the legs, they were four\\r\\nstraight limbs cut from trees and stuck fast into the body, being spread wide\\r\\napart so that the saw-horse would stand firmly when a log was laid across it to\\r\\nbe sawed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This thing resembles a real horse more than I imagined,” said Tip,\\r\\ntrying to explain. “But a real horse is alive, and trots and prances and\\r\\neats oats, while this is nothing more than a dead horse, made of wood, and used\\r\\nto saw logs upon.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If it were alive, wouldn’t it trot, and prance, and eat\\r\\noats?” inquired the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It would trot and prance, perhaps; but it wouldn’t eat\\r\\noats,” replied the boy, laughing at the idea. “And of course it\\r\\ncan’t ever be alive, because it is made of wood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So am I,” answered the man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip looked at him in surprise.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, so you are!” he exclaimed. “And the magic powder that\\r\\nbrought you to life is here in my pocket.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nHe brought out the pepper box, and eyed it curiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wonder,” said he, musingly, “if it would bring the\\r\\nsaw-horse to life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If it would,” returned Jack, calmly for nothing seemed to surprise\\r\\nhim “I could ride on its back, and that would save my joints from wearing\\r\\nout.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll try it!” cried the boy, jumping up. “But I wonder\\r\\nif I can remember the words old Mombi said, and the way she held her hands\\r\\nup.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe thought it over for a minute, and as he had watched carefully from the hedge\\r\\nevery motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he believed he could\\r\\nrepeat exactly what she had said and done.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he began by sprinkling some of the magic Powder of Life from the pepper-box\\r\\nupon the body of the saw-horse. Then he lifted his left hand, with the little\\r\\nfinger pointing upward, and said: “Weaugh!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What does that mean, dear father?” asked Jack, curiously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” answered Tip. Then he lifted his right hand,\\r\\nwith the thumb pointing upward and said: “Teaugh!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What’s that, dear father?” inquired Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It means you must keep quiet!” replied the boy, provoked at being\\r\\ninterrupted at so important a moment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How fast I am learning!” remarked the Pumpkinhead, with his\\r\\neternal smile.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip now lifted both hands above his head, with all the fingers and thumbs\\r\\nspread out, and cried in a loud voice: “Peaugh!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nImmediately the saw-horse moved, stretched its legs, yawned with its\\r\\nchopped-out mouth, and shook a few grains of the powder off its back. The rest\\r\\nof the powder seemed to have vanished into the body of the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good!” called Jack, while the boy looked on in astonishment.\\r\\n“You are a very clever sorcerer, dear father!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Awakening of the Saw-horse\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse, finding himself alive, seemed even more astonished than Tip. He\\r\\nrolled his knotty eyes from side to side, taking a first wondering view of the\\r\\nworld in which he had now so important an existence. Then he tried to look at\\r\\nhimself; but he had, indeed, no neck to turn; so that in the endeavor to see\\r\\nhis body he kept circling around and around, without catching even a glimpse of\\r\\nit. His legs were stiff and awkward, for there were no knee-joints in them; so\\r\\nthat presently he bumped against Jack Pumpkinhead and sent that personage\\r\\ntumbling upon the moss that lined the roadside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip became alarmed at this accident, as well as at the persistence of the\\r\\nSaw-Horse in prancing around in a circle; so he called out:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Whoa! Whoa, there!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse paid no attention whatever to this command, and the next instant\\r\\nbrought one of his wooden legs down upon Tip’s foot so forcibly that the\\r\\nboy danced away in pain to a safer distance, from where he again yelled:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Whoa! Whoa, I say!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack had now managed to raise himself to a sitting position, and he looked at\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse with much interest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe the animal can hear you,” he remarked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shout loud enough, don’t I?” answered Tip, angrily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; but the horse has no ears,” said the smiling Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sure enough!” exclaimed Tip, noting the fact for the first time.\\r\\n“How, then, am I going to stop him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut at that instant the Saw-Horse stopped himself, having concluded it was\\r\\nimpossible to see his own body. He saw Tip, however, and came close to the boy\\r\\nto observe him more fully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was really comical to see the creature walk; for it moved the legs on its\\r\\nright side together, and those on its left side together, as a pacing horse\\r\\ndoes; and that made its body rock sidewise, like a cradle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip patted it upon the head, and said “Good boy! Good Boy!” in a\\r\\ncoaxing tone; and the Saw-Horse pranced away to examine with its bulging eyes\\r\\nthe form of Jack Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must find a halter for him,” said Tip; and having made a search\\r\\nin his pocket he produced a roll of strong cord. Unwinding this, he approached\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse and tied the cord around its neck, afterward fastening the other\\r\\nend to a large tree. The Saw-Horse, not understanding the action, stepped\\r\\nbackward and snapped the string easily; but it made no attempt to run away.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He’s stronger than I thought,” said the boy, “and\\r\\nrather obstinate, too.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you make him some ears?” asked Jack. “Then\\r\\nyou can tell him what to do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That’s a splendid idea!” said Tip. “How did you happen\\r\\nto think of it?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, I didn’t think of it,” answered the Pumpkinhead;\\r\\n“I didn’t need to, for it’s the simplest and easiest thing to\\r\\ndo.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Tip got out his knife and fashioned some ears out of the bark of a small\\r\\ntree.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I mustn’t make them too big,” he said, as he whittled,\\r\\n“or our horse would become a donkey.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How is that?” inquired Jack, from the roadside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, a horse has bigger ears than a man; and a donkey has bigger ears\\r\\nthan a horse,” explained Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, if my ears were longer, would I be a horse?” asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend,” said Tip, gravely, “you’ll never be\\r\\nanything but a Pumpkinhead, no matter how big your ears are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh,” returned Jack, nodding; “I think I understand.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you do, you’re a wonder,” remarked the boy “but\\r\\nthere’s no harm in thinking you understand. I guess these ears are\\r\\nready now. Will you hold the horse while I stick them on?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly, if you’ll help me up,” said Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Tip raised him to his feet, and the Pumpkinhead went to the horse and held\\r\\nits head while the boy bored two holes in it with his knife-blade and inserted\\r\\nthe ears.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They make him look very handsome,” said Jack, admiringly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut those words, spoken close to the Saw-Horse, and being the first sounds he\\r\\nhad ever heard, so startled the animal that he made a bound forward and tumbled\\r\\nTip on one side and Jack on the other. Then he continued to rush forward as if\\r\\nfrightened by the clatter of his own foot-steps.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Whoa!” shouted Tip, picking himself up; “whoa! you idiot\\r\\nwhoa!” The Saw-Horse would probably have paid no attention to this, but\\r\\njust then it stepped a leg into a gopher-hole and stumbled head-over-heels to\\r\\nthe ground, where it lay upon its back, frantically waving its four legs in the\\r\\nair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip ran up to it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’re a nice sort of a horse, I must say!” he exclaimed.\\r\\n“Why didn’t you stop when I yelled ‘whoa?’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Does ‘whoa’ mean to stop?” asked the Saw-Horse, in a\\r\\nsurprised voice, as it rolled its eyes upward to look at the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course it does,” answered Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And a hole in the ground means to stop, also, doesn’t it?”\\r\\ncontinued the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure; unless you step over it,” said Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What a strange place this is,” the creature exclaimed, as if\\r\\namazed. “What am I doing here, anyway?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, I’ve brought you to life,” answered the boy “but\\r\\nit won’t hurt you any, if you mind me and do as I tell you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I will do as you tell me,” replied the Saw-Horse, humbly.\\r\\n“But what happened to me, a moment ago? I don’t seem to be just\\r\\nright, someway.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’re upside down,” explained Tip. “But just keep\\r\\nthose legs still a minute and I’ll set you right side up again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How many sides have I?” asked the creature, wonderingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Several,” said Tip, briefly. “But do keep those legs\\r\\nstill.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse now became quiet, and held its legs rigid; so that Tip, after\\r\\nseveral efforts, was able to roll him over and set him upright.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, I seem all right now,” said the queer animal, with a sigh.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One of your ears is broken,” Tip announced, after a careful\\r\\nexamination. “I’ll have to make a new one.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he led the Saw-Horse back to where Jack was vainly struggling to regain\\r\\nhis feet, and after assisting the Pumpkinhead to stand upright Tip whittled out\\r\\na new ear and fastened it to the horse’s head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said he, addressing his steed, “pay attention to what\\r\\nI’m going to tell you. ‘Whoa!’ means to stop;\\r\\n‘Get-Up!’ means to walk forward; ‘Trot!’ means to go as\\r\\nfast as you can. Understand?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe I do,” returned the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good. We are all going on a journey to the Emerald City, to see His\\r\\nMajesty, the Scarecrow; and Jack Pumpkinhead is going to ride on your back, so\\r\\nhe won’t wear out his joints.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t mind,” said the Saw-Horse. “Anything that\\r\\nsuits you suits me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Tip assisted Jack to get upon the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hold on tight,” he cautioned, “or you may fall off and crack\\r\\nyour pumpkin head.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That would be horrible!” said Jack, with a shudder. “What\\r\\nshall I hold on to?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, hold on to his ears,” replied Tip, after a moment’s\\r\\nhesitation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t do that!” remonstrated the Saw-Horse; “for then\\r\\nI can’t hear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat seemed reasonable, so Tip tried to think of something else.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll fix it!” said he, at length. He went into the wood and\\r\\ncut a short length of limb from a young, stout tree. One end of this he\\r\\nsharpened to a point, and then he dug a hole in the back of the Saw-Horse, just\\r\\nbehind its head. Next he brought a piece of rock from the road and hammered the\\r\\npost firmly into the animal’s back.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stop! Stop!” shouted the horse; “you’re jarring me\\r\\nterribly.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Does it hurt?” asked the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not exactly hurt,” answered the animal; “but it makes me\\r\\nquite nervous to be jarred.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, it’s all over now” said Tip, encouragingly.\\r\\n“Now, Jack, be sure to hold fast to this post and then you can’t\\r\\nfall off and get smashed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Jack held on tight, and Tip said to the horse:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Get up.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe obedient creature at once walked forward, rocking from side to side as he\\r\\nraised his feet from the ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip walked beside the Saw-Horse, quite content with this addition to their\\r\\nparty. Presently he began to whistle.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What does that sound mean?” asked the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t pay any attention to it,” said Tip. “I’m\\r\\njust whistling, and that only means I’m pretty well satisfied.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’d whistle myself, if I could push my lips together,”\\r\\nremarked Jack. “I fear, dear father, that in some respects I am sadly\\r\\nlacking.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter journeying on for some distance the narrow path they were following\\r\\nturned into a broad roadway, paved with yellow brick. By the side of the road\\r\\nTip noticed a sign-post that read:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“NINE MILES TO THE EMERALD CITY.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut it was now growing dark, so he decided to camp for the night by the\\r\\nroadside and to resume the journey next morning by daybreak. He led the\\r\\nSaw-Horse to a grassy mound upon which grew several bushy trees, and carefully\\r\\nassisted the Pumpkinhead to alight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think I’ll lay you upon the ground, overnight,” said the\\r\\nboy. “You will be safer that way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How about me?” asked the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It won’t hurt you to stand,” replied Tip; “and, as you\\r\\ncan’t sleep, you may as well watch out and see that no one comes near to\\r\\ndisturb us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the boy stretched himself upon the grass beside the Pumpkinhead, and being\\r\\ngreatly wearied by the journey was soon fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nJack Pumpkinhead’s Ride to the Emerald City\\n\\r\\nAt daybreak Tip was awakened by the Pumpkinhead. He rubbed the sleep from his\\r\\neyes, bathed in a little brook, and then ate a portion of his bread and cheese.\\r\\nHaving thus prepared for a new day the boy said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us start at once. Nine miles is quite a distance, but we ought to\\r\\nreach the Emerald City by noon if no accidents happen.” So the\\r\\nPumpkinhead was again perched upon the back of the Saw-Horse and the journey\\r\\nwas resumed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip noticed that the purple tint of the grass and trees had now faded to a dull\\r\\nlavender, and before long this lavender appeared to take on a greenish tinge\\r\\nthat gradually brightened as they drew nearer to the great City where the\\r\\nScarecrow ruled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe little party had traveled but a short two miles upon their way when the\\r\\nroad of yellow brick was parted by a broad and swift river. Tip was puzzled how\\r\\nto cross over; but after a time he discovered a man in a ferry-boat approaching\\r\\nfrom the other side of the stream.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the man reached the bank Tip asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Will you row us to the other side?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, if you have money,” returned the ferryman, whose face looked\\r\\ncross and disagreeable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I have no money,” said Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None at all?” inquired the man.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“None at all,” answered the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I’ll not break my back rowing you over,” said the\\r\\nferryman, decidedly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What a nice man!” remarked the Pumpkinhead, smilingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe ferryman stared at him, but made no reply. Tip was trying to think, for it\\r\\nwas a great disappointment to him to find his journey so suddenly brought to an\\r\\nend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must certainly get to the Emerald City,” he said to the boatman;\\r\\n“but how can I cross the river if you do not take me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man laughed, and it was not a nice laugh.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That wooden horse will float,” said he; “and you can ride\\r\\nhim across. As for the pumpkinheaded loon who accompanies you, let him sink or\\r\\nswim it won’t matter greatly which.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry about me,” said Jack, smiling pleasantly upon\\r\\nthe crabbed ferryman; “I’m sure I ought to float\\r\\nbeautifully.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip thought the experiment was worth making, and the Saw-Horse, who did not\\r\\nknow what danger meant, offered no objections whatever. So the boy led it down\\r\\ninto the water and climbed upon its back. Jack also waded in up to his knees\\r\\nand grasped the tail of the horse so that he might keep his pumpkin head above\\r\\nthe water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said Tip, instructing the Saw-Horse, “if you wiggle\\r\\nyour legs you will probably swim; and if you swim we shall probably reach the\\r\\nother side.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse at once began to wiggle its legs, which acted as oars and moved\\r\\nthe adventurers slowly across the river to the opposite side. So successful was\\r\\nthe trip that presently they were climbing, wet and dripping, up the grassy\\r\\nbank.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip’s trouser-legs and shoes were thoroughly soaked; but the Saw-Horse\\r\\nhad floated so perfectly that from his knees up the boy was entirely dry. As\\r\\nfor the Pumpkinhead, every stitch of his gorgeous clothing dripped water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The sun will soon dry us,” said Tip “and, anyhow, we are now\\r\\nsafely across, in spite of the ferryman, and can continue our journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t mind swimming, at all,” remarked the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nor did I,” added Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey soon regained the road of yellow brick, which proved to be a continuation\\r\\nof the road they had left on the other side, and then Tip once more mounted the\\r\\nPumpkinhead upon the back of the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you ride fast,” said he, “the wind will help to dry your\\r\\nclothing. I will hold on to the horse’s tail and run after you. In this\\r\\nway we all will become dry in a very short time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then the horse must step lively,” said Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll do my best,” returned the Saw-Horse, cheerfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip grasped the end of the branch that served as tail to the Saw-Horse, and\\r\\ncalled loudly: “Get-up!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe horse started at a good pace, and Tip followed behind. Then he decided they\\r\\ncould go faster, so he shouted: “Trot!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nNow, the Saw-Horse remembered that this word was the command to go as fast as\\r\\nhe could; so he began rocking along the road at a tremendous pace, and Tip had\\r\\nhard work—running faster than he ever had before in his life—to\\r\\nkeep his feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSoon he was out of breath, and although he wanted to call “Whoa!”\\r\\nto the horse, he found he could not get the word out of his throat. Then the\\r\\nend of the tail he was clutching, being nothing more than a dead branch,\\r\\nsuddenly broke away, and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the\\r\\nroad, while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider dashed on and quickly\\r\\ndisappeared in the distance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy the time Tip had picked himself up and cleared the dust from his throat so\\r\\nhe could say “Whoa!” there was no further need of saying it, for\\r\\nthe horse was long since out of sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he did the only sensible thing he could do. He sat down and took a good\\r\\nrest, and afterward began walking along the road.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Some time I will surely overtake them,” he reflected; “for\\r\\nthe road will end at the gates of the Emerald City, and they can go no further\\r\\nthan that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeantime Jack was holding fast to the post and the Saw-Horse was tearing along\\r\\nthe road like a racer. Neither of them knew Tip was left behind, for the\\r\\nPumpkinhead did not look around and the Saw-Horse couldn’t.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he rode, Jack noticed that the grass and trees had become a bright\\r\\nemerald-green in color, so he guessed they were nearing the Emerald City even\\r\\nbefore the tall spires and domes came into sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt length a high wall of green stone, studded thick with emeralds, loomed up\\r\\nbefore them; and fearing the Saw-Horse would not know enough to stop and so\\r\\nmight smash them both against this wall, Jack ventured to cry\\r\\n“Whoa!” as loud as he could.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo suddenly did the horse obey that had it not been for his post Jack would\\r\\nhave been pitched off head foremost, and his beautiful face ruined.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That was a fast ride, dear father!” he exclaimed; and then,\\r\\nhearing no reply, he turned around and discovered for the first time that Tip\\r\\nwas not there.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis apparent desertion puzzled the Pumpkinhead, and made him uneasy. And while\\r\\nhe was wondering what had become of the boy, and what he ought to do next under\\r\\nsuch trying circumstances, the gateway in the green wall opened and a man came\\r\\nout.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis man was short and round, with a fat face that seemed remarkably\\r\\ngood-natured. He was clothed all in green and wore a high, peaked green hat\\r\\nupon his head and green spectacles over his eyes. Bowing before the Pumpkinhead\\r\\nhe said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am the Guardian of the Gates of the Emerald City. May I inquire who\\r\\nyou are, and what is your business?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My name is Jack Pumpkinhead,” returned the other, smilingly;\\r\\n“but as to my business, I haven’t the least idea in the world what\\r\\nit is.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Guardian of the Gates looked surprised, and shook his head as if\\r\\ndissatisfied with the reply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What are you, a man or a pumpkin?” he asked, politely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Both, if you please,” answered Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And this wooden horse—is it alive?” questioned the Guardian.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe horse rolled one knotty eye upward and winked at Jack. Then it gave a\\r\\nprance and brought one leg down on the Guardian’s toes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ouch!” cried the man; “I’m sorry I asked that\\r\\nquestion. But the answer is most convincing. Have you any errand, sir, in the\\r\\nEmerald City?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me that I have,” replied the Pumpkinhead, seriously;\\r\\n“but I cannot think what it is. My father knows all about it, but he is\\r\\nnot here.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is a strange affair very strange!” declared the Guardian.\\r\\n“But you seem harmless. Folks do not smile so delightfully when they mean\\r\\nmischief.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for that,” said Jack, “I cannot help my smile, for it is\\r\\ncarved on my face with a jack-knife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, come with me into my room,” resumed the Guardian, “and\\r\\nI will see what can be done for you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Jack rode the Saw-Horse through the gateway into a little room built into\\r\\nthe wall. The Guardian pulled a bell-cord, and presently a very tall\\r\\nsoldier—clothed in a green uniform—entered from the opposite door.\\r\\nThis soldier carried a long green gun over his shoulder and had lovely green\\r\\nwhiskers that fell quite to his knees. The Guardian at once addressed him,\\r\\nsaying:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is a strange gentleman who doesn’t know why he has come to\\r\\nthe Emerald City, or what he wants. Tell me, what shall we do with him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Soldier with the Green Whiskers looked at Jack with much care and\\r\\ncuriosity. Finally he shook his head so positively that little waves rippled\\r\\ndown his whiskers, and then he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must take him to His Majesty, the Scarecrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But what will His Majesty, the Scarecrow, do with him?” asked the\\r\\nGuardian of the Gates.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is His Majesty’s business,” returned the soldier.\\r\\n“I have troubles enough of my own. All outside troubles must be turned\\r\\nover to His Majesty. So put the spectacles on this fellow, and I’ll take\\r\\nhim to the royal palace.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Guardian opened a big box of spectacles and tried to fit a pair to\\r\\nJack’s great round eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I haven’t a pair in stock that will really cover those eyes\\r\\nup,” said the little man, with a sigh; “and your head is so big\\r\\nthat I shall be obliged to tie the spectacles on.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why need I wear spectacles?” asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s the fashion here,” said the Soldier, “and they\\r\\nwill keep you from being blinded by the glitter and glare of the gorgeous\\r\\nEmerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” exclaimed Jack. “Tie them on, by all means. I\\r\\ndon’t wish to be blinded.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nor I!” broke in the Saw-Horse; so a pair of green spectacles was\\r\\nquickly fastened over the bulging knots that served it for eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the Soldier with the Green Whiskers led them through the inner gate and\\r\\nthey at once found themselves in the main street of the magnificent Emerald\\r\\nCity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSparkling green gems ornamented the fronts of the beautiful houses and the\\r\\ntowers and turrets were all faced with emeralds. Even the green marble pavement\\r\\nglittered with precious stones, and it was indeed a grand and marvelous sight\\r\\nto one who beheld it for the first time.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever, the Pumpkinhead and the Saw-Horse, knowing nothing of wealth and\\r\\nbeauty, paid little attention to the wonderful sights they saw through their\\r\\ngreen spectacles. They calmly followed after the green soldier and scarcely\\r\\nnoticed the crowds of green people who stared at them in surprise. When a green\\r\\ndog ran out and barked at them the Saw-Horse promptly kicked at it with its\\r\\nwooden leg and sent the little animal howling into one of the houses; but\\r\\nnothing more serious than this happened to interrupt their progress to the\\r\\nroyal palace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Pumpkinhead wanted to ride up the green marble steps and straight into the\\r\\nScarecrow’s presence; but the soldier would not permit that. So Jack\\r\\ndismounted, with much difficulty, and a servant led the Saw-Horse around to the\\r\\nrear while the Soldier with the Green Whiskers escorted the Pumpkinhead into\\r\\nthe palace, by the front entrance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe stranger was left in a handsomely furnished waiting room while the soldier\\r\\nwent to announce him. It so happened that at this hour His Majesty was at\\r\\nleisure and greatly bored for want of something to do, so he ordered his\\r\\nvisitor to be shown at once into his throne room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack felt no fear or embarrassment at meeting the ruler of this magnificent\\r\\ncity, for he was entirely ignorant of all worldly customs. But when he entered\\r\\nthe room and saw for the first time His Majesty the Scarecrow seated upon his\\r\\nglittering throne, he stopped short in amazement.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nHis Majesty the Scarecrow\\n\\r\\nI suppose every reader of this book knows what a scarecrow is; but Jack\\r\\nPumpkinhead, never having seen such a creation, was more surprised at meeting\\r\\nthe remarkable King of the Emerald City than by any other one experience of his\\r\\nbrief life.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis Majesty the Scarecrow was dressed in a suit of faded blue clothes, and his\\r\\nhead was merely a small sack stuffed with straw, upon which eyes, ears, a nose\\r\\nand a mouth had been rudely painted to represent a face. The clothes were also\\r\\nstuffed with straw, and that so unevenly or carelessly that his Majesty’s\\r\\nlegs and arms seemed more bumpy than was necessary. Upon his hands were gloves\\r\\nwith long fingers, and these were padded with cotton. Wisps of straw stuck out\\r\\nfrom the monarch’s coat and also from his neck and boot-tops. Upon his\\r\\nhead he wore a heavy golden crown set thick with sparkling jewels, and the\\r\\nweight of this crown caused his brow to sag in wrinkles, giving a thoughtful\\r\\nexpression to the painted face. Indeed, the crown alone betokened majesty; in\\r\\nall else the, Scarecrow King was but a simple scarecrow—flimsy, awkward,\\r\\nand unsubstantial.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut if the strange appearance of his Majesty the Scarecrow seemed startling to\\r\\nJack, no less wonderful was the form of the Pumpkinhead to the Scarecrow. The\\r\\npurple trousers and pink waistcoat and red shirt hung loosely over the wooden\\r\\njoints Tip had manufactured, and the carved face on the pumpkin grinned\\r\\nperpetually, as if its wearer considered life the jolliest thing imaginable.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt first, indeed, His Majesty thought his queer visitor was laughing at him,\\r\\nand was inclined to resent such a liberty; but it was not without reason that\\r\\nthe Scarecrow had attained the reputation of being the wisest personage in the\\r\\nLand of Oz. He made a more careful examination of his visitor, and soon\\r\\ndiscovered that Jack’s features were carved into a smile and that he\\r\\ncould not look grave if he wished to.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe King was the first to speak. After regarding Jack for some minutes he said,\\r\\nin a tone of wonder:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where on earth did you come from, and how do you happen to be\\r\\nalive?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg your Majesty’s pardon,” returned the Pumpkinhead;\\r\\n“but I do not understand you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What don’t you understand?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, I don’t understand your language. You see, I came from the\\r\\nCountry of the Gillikins, so that I am a foreigner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah, to be sure!” exclaimed the Scarecrow. “I myself speak\\r\\nthe language of the Munchkins, which is also the language of the Emerald City.\\r\\nBut you, I suppose, speak the language of the Pumpkinheads?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Exactly so, your Majesty” replied the other, bowing; “so it\\r\\nwill be impossible for us to understand one another.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is unfortunate, certainly,” said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully.\\r\\n“We must have an interpreter.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is an interpreter?” asked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A person who understands both my language and your own. When I say\\r\\nanything, the interpreter can tell you what I mean; and when you say anything\\r\\nthe interpreter can tell me what you mean. For the interpreter can speak\\r\\nboth languages as well as understand them.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is certainly clever,” said Jack, greatly pleased at finding\\r\\nso simple a way out of the difficulty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Scarecrow commanded the Soldier with the Green Whiskers to search among\\r\\nhis people until he found one who understood the language of the Gillikins as\\r\\nwell as the language of the Emerald City, and to bring that person to him at\\r\\nonce.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the Soldier had departed the Scarecrow said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t you take a chair while we are waiting?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your Majesty forgets that I cannot understand you,” replied the\\r\\nPumpkinhead. “If you wish me to sit down you must make a sign for me to\\r\\ndo so.” The Scarecrow came down from his throne and rolled an armchair to\\r\\na position behind the Pumpkinhead. Then he gave Jack a sudden push that sent\\r\\nhim sprawling upon the cushions in so awkward a fashion that he doubled up like\\r\\na jackknife, and had hard work to untangle himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Did you understand that sign?” asked His Majesty, politely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perfectly,” declared Jack, reaching up his arms to turn his head\\r\\nto the front, the pumpkin having twisted around upon the stick that supported\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You seem hastily made,” remarked the Scarecrow, watching\\r\\nJack’s efforts to straighten himself.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not more so than your Majesty,” was the frank reply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There is this difference between us,” said the Scarecrow,\\r\\n“that whereas I will bend, but not break, you will break, but not\\r\\nbend.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the soldier returned leading a young girl by the hand. She\\r\\nseemed very sweet and modest, having a pretty face and beautiful green eyes and\\r\\nhair. A dainty green silk skirt reached to her knees, showing silk stockings\\r\\nembroidered with pea-pods, and green satin slippers with bunches of lettuce for\\r\\ndecorations instead of bows or buckles. Upon her silken waist clover leaves\\r\\nwere embroidered, and she wore a jaunty little jacket trimmed with sparkling\\r\\nemeralds of a uniform size.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s little Jellia Jamb!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, as\\r\\nthe green maiden bowed her pretty head before him. “Do you understand the\\r\\nlanguage of the Gillikins, my dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, your Majesty,” she answered, “for I was born in the\\r\\nNorth Country.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you shall be our interpreter,” said the Scarecrow, “and\\r\\nexplain to this Pumpkinhead all that I say, and also explain to me all that\\r\\nhe says. Is this arrangement satisfactory?” he asked, turning\\r\\ntoward his guest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very satisfactory indeed,” was the reply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then ask him, to begin with,” resumed the Scarecrow, turning to\\r\\nJellia, “what brought him to the Emerald City”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut instead of this the girl, who had been staring at Jack, said to him:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are certainly a wonderful creature. Who made you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A boy named Tip,” answered Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What does he say?” inquired the Scarecrow. “My ears must\\r\\nhave deceived me. What did he say?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He says that your Majesty’s brains seem to have come loose,”\\r\\nreplied the girl, demurely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow moved uneasily upon his throne, and felt of his head with his\\r\\nleft hand.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What a fine thing it is to understand two different languages,” he\\r\\nsaid, with a perplexed sigh. “Ask him, my dear, if he has any objection\\r\\nto being put in jail for insulting the ruler of the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t insult you!” protested Jack, indignantly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tut—tut!” cautioned the Scarecrow “wait, until Jellia\\r\\ntranslates my speech. What have we got an interpreter for, if you break out in\\r\\nthis rash way?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All right, I’ll wait,” replied the Pumpkinhead, in a surly\\r\\ntone—although his face smiled as genially as ever. “Translate the\\r\\nspeech, young woman.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“His Majesty inquires if you are hungry,” said Jellia.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, not at all!” answered Jack, more pleasantly, “for it is\\r\\nimpossible for me to eat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s the same way with me,” remarked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“What did he say, Jellia, my dear?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He asked if you were aware that one of your eyes is painted larger than\\r\\nthe other,” said the girl, mischievously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you believe her, your Majesty,” cried Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I don’t,” answered the Scarecrow, calmly. Then, casting\\r\\na sharp look at the girl, he asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you quite certain you understand the languages of both the Gillikins\\r\\nand the Munchkins?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite certain, your Majesty,” said Jellia Jamb, trying hard not to\\r\\nlaugh in the face of royalty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then how is it that I seem to understand them myself?” inquired\\r\\nthe Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because they are one and the same!” declared the girl, now\\r\\nlaughing merrily. “Does not your Majesty know that in all the land of Oz\\r\\nbut one language is spoken?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is it indeed so?” cried the Scarecrow, much relieved to hear this;\\r\\n“then I might easily have been my own interpreter!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was all my fault, your Majesty,” said Jack, looking rather\\r\\nfoolish, “I thought we must surely speak different languages, since we\\r\\ncame from different countries.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This should be a warning to you never to think,” returned the\\r\\nScarecrow, severely. “For unless one can think wisely it is better to\\r\\nremain a dummy—which you most certainly are.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am!—I surely am!” agreed the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me,” continued the Scarecrow, more mildly, “that\\r\\nyour manufacturer spoiled some good pies to create an indifferent man.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I assure your Majesty that I did not ask to be created,” answered\\r\\nJack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! It was the same in my case,” said the King, pleasantly.\\r\\n“And so, as we differ from all ordinary people, let us become\\r\\nfriends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“With all my heart!” exclaimed Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What! Have you a heart?” asked the Scarecrow, surprised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; that was only imaginative—I might say, a figure of\\r\\nspeech,” said the other.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, your most prominent figure seems to be a figure of wood; so I must\\r\\nbeg you to restrain an imagination which, having no brains, you have no right\\r\\nto exercise,” suggested the Scarecrow, warningly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure!” said Jack, without in the least comprehending.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis Majesty then dismissed Jellia Jamb and the Soldier with the Green Whiskers,\\r\\nand when they were gone he took his new friend by the arm and led him into the\\r\\ncourtyard to play a game of quoits.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nGen. Jinjur’s Army of Revolt\\n\\r\\nTip was so anxious to rejoin his man Jack and the Saw-Horse that he walked a\\r\\nfull half the distance to the Emerald City without stopping to rest. Then he\\r\\ndiscovered that he was hungry and the crackers and cheese he had provided for\\r\\nthe Journey had all been eaten.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile wondering what he should do in this emergency he came upon a girl sitting\\r\\nby the roadside. She wore a costume that struck the boy as being remarkably\\r\\nbrilliant: her silken waist being of emerald green and her skirt of four\\r\\ndistinct colors—blue in front, yellow at the left side, red at the back\\r\\nand purple at the right side. Fastening the waist in front were four\\r\\nbuttons—the top one blue, the next yellow, a third red and the last\\r\\npurple.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe splendor of this dress was almost barbaric; so Tip was fully justified in\\r\\nstaring at the gown for some moments before his eyes were attracted by the\\r\\npretty face above it. Yes, the face was pretty enough, he decided; but it wore\\r\\nan expression of discontent coupled to a shade of defiance or audacity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile the boy stared the girl looked upon him calmly. A lunch basket stood\\r\\nbeside her, and she held a dainty sandwich in one hand and a hard-boiled egg in\\r\\nthe other, eating with an evident appetite that aroused Tip’s sympathy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe was just about to ask a share of the luncheon when the girl stood up and\\r\\nbrushed the crumbs from her lap.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There!” said she; “it is time for me to go. Carry that\\r\\nbasket for me and help yourself to its contents if you are hungry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip seized the basket eagerly and began to eat, following for a time the\\r\\nstrange girl without bothering to ask questions. She walked along before him\\r\\nwith swift strides, and there was about her an air of decision and importance\\r\\nthat led him to suspect she was some great personage.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinally, when he had satisfied his hunger, he ran up beside her and tried to\\r\\nkeep pace with her swift footsteps—a very difficult feat, for she was\\r\\nmuch taller than he, and evidently in a hurry.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you very much for the sandwiches,” said Tip, as he trotted\\r\\nalong. “May I ask your name?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am General Jinjur,” was the brief reply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” said the boy surprised. “What sort of a General?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I command the Army of Revolt in this war,” answered the General,\\r\\nwith unnecessary sharpness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” he again exclaimed. “I didn’t know there was a\\r\\nwar.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You were not supposed to know it,” she returned, “for we\\r\\nhave kept it a secret; and considering that our army is composed entirely of\\r\\ngirls,” she added, with some pride, “it is surely a remarkable\\r\\nthing that our Revolt is not yet discovered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is, indeed,” acknowledged Tip. “But where is your\\r\\narmy?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“About a mile from here,” said General Jinjur. “The forces\\r\\nhave assembled from all parts of the Land of Oz, at my express command. For\\r\\nthis is the day we are to conquer His Majesty the Scarecrow, and wrest from him\\r\\nthe throne. The Army of Revolt only awaits my coming to march upon the Emerald\\r\\nCity.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well!” declared Tip, drawing a long breath, “this is\\r\\ncertainly a surprising thing! May I ask why you wish to conquer His Majesty the\\r\\nScarecrow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because the Emerald City has been ruled by men long enough, for one\\r\\nreason,” said the girl.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Moreover, the City glitters with beautiful gems, which might far better\\r\\nbe used for rings, bracelets and necklaces; and there is enough money in the\\r\\nKing’s treasury to buy every girl in our Army a dozen new gowns. So we\\r\\nintend to conquer the City and run the government to suit ourselves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJinjur spoke these words with an eagerness and decision that proved she was in\\r\\nearnest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But war is a terrible thing,” said Tip, thoughtfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This war will be pleasant,” replied the girl, cheerfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Many of you will be slain!” continued the boy, in an awed voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no”, said Jinjur. “What man would oppose a girl, or dare\\r\\nto harm her? And there is not an ugly face in my entire Army.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip laughed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you are right,” said he. “But the Guardian of the\\r\\nGate is considered a faithful Guardian, and the King’s Army will not let\\r\\nthe City be conquered without a struggle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Army is old and feeble,” replied General Jinjur, scornfully.\\r\\n“His strength has all been used to grow whiskers, and his wife has such a\\r\\ntemper that she has already pulled more than half of them out by the roots.\\r\\nWhen the Wonderful Wizard reigned the Soldier with the Green Whiskers was a\\r\\nvery good Royal Army, for people feared the Wizard. But no one is afraid of the\\r\\nScarecrow, so his Royal Army don’t count for much in time of war.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter this conversation they proceeded some distance in silence, and before\\r\\nlong reached a large clearing in the forest where fully four hundred young\\r\\nwomen were assembled. These were laughing and talking together as gaily as if\\r\\nthey had gathered for a picnic instead of a war of conquest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey were divided into four companies, and Tip noticed that all were dressed in\\r\\ncostumes similar to that worn by General Jinjur. The only real difference was\\r\\nthat while those girls from the Munchkin country had the blue strip in front of\\r\\ntheir skirts, those from the country of the Quadlings had the red strip in\\r\\nfront; and those from the country of the Winkies had the yellow strip in front,\\r\\nand the Gillikin girls wore the purple strip in front. All had green waists,\\r\\nrepresenting the Emerald City they intended to conquer, and the top button on\\r\\neach waist indicated by its color which country the wearer came from. The\\r\\nuniforms were Jaunty and becoming, and quite effective when massed together.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip thought this strange Army bore no weapons whatever; but in this he was\\r\\nwrong. For each girl had stuck through the knot of her back hair two long,\\r\\nglittering knitting-needles.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGeneral Jinjur immediately mounted the stump of a tree and addressed her army.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Friends, fellow-citizens, and girls!” she said; “we are\\r\\nabout to begin our great Revolt against the men of Oz! We march to conquer the\\r\\nEmerald City—to dethrone the Scarecrow King—to acquire thousands of\\r\\ngorgeous gems—to rifle the royal treasury—and to obtain power over\\r\\nour former oppressors!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hurrah!” said those who had listened; but Tip thought most of the\\r\\nArmy was too much engaged in chattering to pay attention to the words of the\\r\\nGeneral.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe command to march was now given, and the girls formed themselves into four\\r\\nbands, or companies, and set off with eager strides toward the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe boy followed after them, carrying several baskets and wraps and packages\\r\\nwhich various members of the Army of Revolt had placed in his care. It was not\\r\\nlong before they came to the green granite walls of the City and halted before\\r\\nthe gateway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Guardian of the Gate at once came out and looked at them curiously, as if a\\r\\ncircus had come to town. He carried a bunch of keys swung round his neck by a\\r\\ngolden chain; his hands were thrust carelessly into his pockets, and he seemed\\r\\nto have no idea at all that the City was threatened by rebels. Speaking\\r\\npleasantly to the girls, he said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good morning, my dears! What can I do for you?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Surrender instantly!” answered General Jinjur, standing before him\\r\\nand frowning as terribly as her pretty face would allow her to.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Surrender!” echoed the man, astounded. “Why, it’s\\r\\nimpossible. It’s against the law! I never heard of such a thing in my\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Still, you must surrender!” exclaimed the General, fiercely.\\r\\n“We are revolting!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You don’t look it,” said the Guardian, gazing from one to\\r\\nanother, admiringly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But we are!” cried Jinjur, stamping her foot, impatiently;\\r\\n“and we mean to conquer the Emerald City!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good gracious!” returned the surprised Guardian of the Gates;\\r\\n“what a nonsensical idea! Go home to your mothers, my good girls, and\\r\\nmilk the cows and bake the bread. Don’t you know it’s a dangerous\\r\\nthing to conquer a city?”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are not afraid!” responded the General; and she looked so\\r\\ndetermined that it made the Guardian uneasy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he rang the bell for the Soldier with the Green Whiskers, and the next\\r\\nminute was sorry he had done so. For immediately he was surrounded by a crowd\\r\\nof girls who drew the knitting-needles from their hair and began Jabbing them\\r\\nat the Guardian with the sharp points dangerously near his fat cheeks and\\r\\nblinking eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe poor man howled loudly for mercy and made no resistance when Jinjur drew\\r\\nthe bunch of keys from around his neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFollowed by her Army the General now rushed to the gateway, where she was\\r\\nconfronted by the Royal Army of Oz—which was the other name for the\\r\\nSoldier with the Green Whiskers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Halt!” he cried, and pointed his long gun full in the face of the\\r\\nleader.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSome of the girls screamed and ran back, but General Jinjur bravely stood her\\r\\nground and said, reproachfully:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, how now? Would you shoot a poor, defenceless girl?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” replied the soldier. “for my gun isn’t\\r\\nloaded.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not loaded?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; for fear of accidents. And I’ve forgotten where I hid the\\r\\npowder and shot to load it with. But if you’ll wait a short time\\r\\nI’ll try to hunt them up.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t trouble yourself,” said Jinjur, cheerfully. Then she\\r\\nturned to her Army and cried:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Girls, the gun isn’t loaded!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hooray,” shrieked the rebels, delighted at this good news, and\\r\\nthey proceeded to rush upon the Soldier with the Green Whiskers in such a crowd\\r\\nthat it was a wonder they didn’t stick the knitting-needles into one\\r\\nanother.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Royal Army of Oz was too much afraid of women to meet the onslaught. He\\r\\nsimply turned about and ran with all his might through the gate and toward the\\r\\nroyal palace, while General Jinjur and her mob flocked into the unprotected\\r\\nCity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIn this way was the Emerald City captured without a drop of blood being\\r\\nspilled. The Army of Revolt had become an Army of Conquerors!\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow Plans an escape\\n\\r\\nTip slipped away from the girls and followed swiftly after the Soldier with the\\r\\nGreen Whiskers. The invading army entered the City more slowly, for they\\r\\nstopped to dig emeralds out of the walls and paving-stones with the points of\\r\\ntheir knitting-needles. So the Soldier and the boy reached the palace before\\r\\nthe news had spread that the City was conquered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead were still playing at quoits in the\\r\\ncourtyard when the game was interrupted by the abrupt entrance of the Royal\\r\\nArmy of Oz, who came flying in without his hat or gun, his clothes in sad\\r\\ndisarray and his long beard floating a yard behind him as he ran.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tally one for me,” said the Scarecrow, calmly “What’s\\r\\nwrong, my man?” he added, addressing the Soldier.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh! your Majesty—your Majesty! The City is conquered!”\\r\\ngasped the Royal Army, who was all out of breath.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is quite sudden,” said the Scarecrow. “But please go\\r\\nand bar all the doors and windows of the palace, while I show this Pumpkinhead\\r\\nhow to throw a quoit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Soldier hastened to do this, while Tip, who had arrived at his heels,\\r\\nremained in the courtyard to look at the Scarecrow with wondering eyes.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis Majesty continued to throw the quoits as coolly as if no danger threatened\\r\\nhis throne, but the Pumpkinhead, having caught sight of Tip, ambled toward the\\r\\nboy as fast as his wooden legs would go.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good afternoon, noble parent!” he cried, delightedly.\\r\\n“I’m glad to see you are here. That terrible Saw-Horse ran away\\r\\nwith me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suspected it,” said Tip. “Did you get hurt? Are you\\r\\ncracked at all?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, I arrived safely,” answered Jack, “and his Majesty has\\r\\nbeen very kind indeed to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this moment the Soldier with the Green Whiskers returned, and the Scarecrow\\r\\nasked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By the way, who has conquered me?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A regiment of girls, gathered from the four corners of the Land of\\r\\nOz,” replied the Soldier, still pale with fear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But where was my Standing Army at the time?” inquired his Majesty,\\r\\nlooking at the Soldier, gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Your Standing Army was running,” answered the fellow, honestly;\\r\\n“for no man could face the terrible weapons of the invaders.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the Scarecrow, after a moment’s thought,\\r\\n“I don’t mind much the loss of my throne, for it’s a tiresome\\r\\njob to rule over the Emerald City. And this crown is so heavy that it makes my\\r\\nhead ache. But I hope the Conquerors have no intention of injuring me, just\\r\\nbecause I happen to be the King.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I heard them, say” remarked Tip, with some hesitation, “that\\r\\nthey intend to make a rag carpet of your outside and stuff their sofa-cushions\\r\\nwith your inside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I am really in danger,” declared his Majesty, positively,\\r\\n“and it will be wise for me to consider a means to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where can you go?” asked Jack Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, to my friend the Tin Woodman, who rules over the Winkies, and calls\\r\\nhimself their Emperor,” was the answer. “I am sure he will protect\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip was looking out the window.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The palace is surrounded by the enemy,” said he. “It is too\\r\\nlate to escape. They would soon tear you to pieces.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow sighed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In an emergency,” he announced, “it is always a good thing\\r\\nto pause and reflect. Please excuse me while I pause and reflect.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But we also are in danger,” said the Pumpkinhead, anxiously.\\r\\n“If any of these girls understand cooking, my end is not far off!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed the Scarecrow. “they’re too busy\\r\\nto cook, even if they know how!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But should I remain here a prisoner for any length of time,”\\r\\nprotested Jack, “I’m liable to spoil.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! then you would not be fit to associate with,” returned the\\r\\nScarecrow. “The matter is more serious than I suspected.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You,” said the Pumpkinhead, gloomily, “are liable to live\\r\\nfor many years. My life is necessarily short. So I must take advantage of the\\r\\nfew days that remain to me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There, there! Don’t worry,” answered the Scarecrow\\r\\nsoothingly; “if you’ll keep quiet long enough for me to think,\\r\\nI’ll try to find some way for us all to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the others waited in patient silence while the Scarecrow walked to a corner\\r\\nand stood with his face to the wall for a good five minutes. At the end of that\\r\\ntime he faced them with a more cheerful expression upon his painted face.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where is the Saw-Horse you rode here?” he asked the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, I said he was a jewel, and so your man locked him up in the royal\\r\\ntreasury,” said Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was the only place I could think of your Majesty,” added the\\r\\nSoldier, fearing he had made a blunder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It pleases me very much,” said the Scarecrow. “Has the\\r\\nanimal been fed?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, yes; I gave him a heaping peck of sawdust.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” cried the Scarecrow. “Bring the horse here at\\r\\nonce.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Soldier hastened away, and presently they heard the clattering of the\\r\\nhorse’s wooden legs upon the pavement as he was led into the courtyard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHis Majesty regarded the steed critically. “He doesn’t seem\\r\\nespecially graceful!” he remarked, musingly. “but I suppose he can\\r\\nrun?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He can, indeed,” said Tip, gazing upon the Saw-Horse admiringly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, bearing us upon his back, he must make a dash through the ranks of\\r\\nthe rebels and carry us to my friend the Tin Woodman,” announced the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He can’t carry four!” objected Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, but he may be induced to carry three,” said his Majesty.\\r\\n“I shall therefore leave my Royal Army Behind. For, from the ease with\\r\\nwhich he was conquered, I have little confidence in his powers.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Still, he can run,” declared Tip, laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I expected this blow” said the Soldier, sulkily; “but I can\\r\\nbear it. I shall disguise myself by cutting off my lovely green whiskers. And,\\r\\nafter all, it is no more dangerous to face those reckless girls than to ride\\r\\nthis fiery, untamed wooden horse!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you are right,” observed his Majesty. “But, for my\\r\\npart, not being a soldier, I am fond of danger. Now, my boy, you must mount\\r\\nfirst. And please sit as close to the horse’s neck as possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip climbed quickly to his place, and the Soldier and the Scarecrow managed to\\r\\nhoist the Pumpkinhead to a seat just behind him. There remained so little space\\r\\nfor the King that he was liable to fall off as soon as the horse started.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fetch a clothesline,” said the King to his Army, “and tie us\\r\\nall together. Then if one falls off we will all fall off.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd while the Soldier was gone for the clothesline his Majesty continued,\\r\\n“it is well for me to be careful, for my very existence is in\\r\\ndanger.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have to be as careful as you do,” said Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not exactly,” replied the Scarecrow. “for if anything\\r\\nhappened to me, that would be the end of me. But if anything happened to you,\\r\\nthey could use you for seed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Soldier now returned with a long line and tied all three firmly together,\\r\\nalso lashing them to the body of the Saw-Horse; so there seemed little danger\\r\\nof their tumbling off.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now throw open the gates,” commanded the Scarecrow, “and we\\r\\nwill make a dash to liberty or to death.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe courtyard in which they were standing was located in the center of the\\r\\ngreat palace, which surrounded it on all sides. But in one place a passage led\\r\\nto an outer gateway, which the Soldier had barred by order of his sovereign. It\\r\\nwas through this gateway his Majesty proposed to escape, and the Royal Army now\\r\\nled the Saw-Horse along the passage and unbarred the gate, which swung backward\\r\\nwith a loud crash.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said Tip to the horse, “you must save us all. Run as\\r\\nfast as you can for the gate of the City, and don’t let anything stop\\r\\nyou.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All right!” answered the Saw-Horse, gruffly, and dashed away so\\r\\nsuddenly that Tip had to gasp for breath and hold firmly to the post he had\\r\\ndriven into the creature’s neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeveral of the girls, who stood outside guarding the palace, were knocked over\\r\\nby the Saw-Horse’s mad rush. Others ran screaming out of the way, and\\r\\nonly one or two jabbed their knitting-needles frantically at the escaping\\r\\nprisoners. Tip got one small prick in his left arm, which smarted for an hour\\r\\nafterward; but the needles had no effect upon the Scarecrow or Jack\\r\\nPumpkinhead, who never even suspected they were being prodded.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs for the Saw-Horse, he made a wonderful record upsetting a fruit cart,\\r\\noverturning several meek looking men, and finally bowling over the new Guardian\\r\\nof the Gate—a fussy little fat woman appointed by General Jinjur.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNor did the impetuous charger stop then. Once outside the walls of the Emerald\\r\\nCity he dashed along the road to the West with fast and violent leaps that\\r\\nshook the breath out of the boy and filled the Scarecrow with wonder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack had ridden at this mad rate once before, so he devoted every effort to\\r\\nholding, with both hands, his pumpkin head upon its stick, enduring meantime\\r\\nthe dreadful jolting with the courage of a philosopher.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Slow him up! Slow him up!” shouted the Scarecrow. “My straw\\r\\nis all shaking down into my legs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Tip had no breath to speak, so the Saw-Horse continued his wild career\\r\\nunchecked and with unabated speed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently they came to the banks of a wide river, and without a pause the\\r\\nwooden steed gave one final leap and launched them all in mid-air.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nA second later they were rolling, splashing and bobbing about in the water, the\\r\\nhorse struggling frantically to find a rest for its feet and its riders being\\r\\nfirst plunged beneath the rapid current and then floating upon the surface like\\r\\ncorks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Journey to the Tin Woodman\\n\\r\\nTip was well soaked and dripping water from every angle of his body. But he\\r\\nmanaged to lean forward and shout in the ear of the Saw-Horse:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Keep still, you fool! Keep still!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe horse at once ceased struggling and floated calmly upon the surface, its\\r\\nwooden body being as buoyant as a raft.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What does that word ‘fool’ mean?” enquired the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a term of reproach,” answered Tip, somewhat ashamed of the\\r\\nexpression. “I only use it when I am angry.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then it pleases me to be able to call you a fool, in return,” said\\r\\nthe horse. “For I did not make the river, nor put it in our way; so only\\r\\na term of, reproach is fit for one who becomes angry with me for falling into\\r\\nthe water.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is quite evident,” replied Tip; “so I will acknowledge\\r\\nmyself in the wrong.” Then he called out to the Pumpkinhead: “are\\r\\nyou all right, Jack?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was no reply. So the boy called to the King “are you all right,\\r\\nyour majesty?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow groaned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m all wrong, somehow,” he said, in a weak voice.\\r\\n“How very wet this water is!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip was bound so tightly by the cord that he could not turn his head to look at\\r\\nhis companions; so he said to the Saw-Horse:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Paddle with your legs toward the shore.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe horse obeyed, and although their progress was slow they finally reached the\\r\\nopposite river bank at a place where it was low enough to enable the creature\\r\\nto scramble upon dry land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith some difficulty the boy managed to get his knife out of his pocket and cut\\r\\nthe cords that bound the riders to one another and to the wooden horse. He\\r\\nheard the Scarecrow fall to the ground with a mushy sound, and then he himself\\r\\nquickly dismounted and looked at his friend Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe wooden body, with its gorgeous clothing, still sat upright upon the\\r\\nhorse’s back; but the pumpkin head was gone, and only the sharpened stick\\r\\nthat served for a neck was visible. As for the Scarecrow, the straw in his body\\r\\nhad shaken down with the jolting and packed itself into his legs and the lower\\r\\npart of his body—which appeared very plump and round while his upper half\\r\\nseemed like an empty sack. Upon his head the Scarecrow still wore the heavy\\r\\ncrown, which had been sewed on to prevent his losing it; but the head was now\\r\\nso damp and limp that the weight of the gold and jewels sagged forward and\\r\\ncrushed the painted face into a mass of wrinkles that made him look exactly\\r\\nlike a Japanese pug dog.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip would have laughed—had he not been so anxious about his man Jack. But\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, however damaged, was all there, while the pumpkin head that was\\r\\nso necessary to Jack’s existence was missing; so the boy seized a long\\r\\npole that fortunately lay near at hand and anxiously turned again toward the\\r\\nriver.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFar out upon the waters he sighted the golden hue of the pumpkin, which gently\\r\\nbobbed up and down with the motion of the waves. At that moment it was quite\\r\\nout of Tip’s reach, but after a time it floated nearer and still nearer\\r\\nuntil the boy was able to reach it with his pole and draw it to the shore. Then\\r\\nhe brought it to the top of the bank, carefully wiped the water from its\\r\\npumpkin face with his handkerchief, and ran with it to Jack and replaced the\\r\\nhead upon the man’s neck.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear me!” were Jack’s first words. “What a dreadful\\r\\nexperience! I wonder if water is liable to spoil pumpkins?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip did not think a reply was necessary, for he knew that the Scarecrow also\\r\\nstood in need of his help. So he carefully removed the straw from the\\r\\nKing’s body and legs, and spread it out in the sun to dry. The wet\\r\\nclothing he hung over the body of the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If water spoils pumpkins,” observed Jack, with a deep sigh,\\r\\n“then my days are numbered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve never noticed that water spoils pumpkins,” returned\\r\\nTip; “unless the water happens to be boiling. If your head isn’t\\r\\ncracked, my friend, you must be in fairly good condition.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, my head isn’t cracked in the least,” declared Jack, more\\r\\ncheerfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then don’t worry,” retorted the boy. “Care once killed\\r\\na cat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,” said Jack, seriously, “I am very glad indeed that I\\r\\nam not a cat.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe sun was fast drying their clothing, and Tip stirred up his Majesty’s\\r\\nstraw so that the warm rays might absorb the moisture and make it as crisp and\\r\\ndry as ever. When this had been accomplished he stuffed the Scarecrow into\\r\\nsymmetrical shape and smoothed out his face so that he wore his usual gay and\\r\\ncharming expression.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you very much,” said the monarch, brightly, as he walked\\r\\nabout and found himself to be well balanced. “There are several distinct\\r\\nadvantages in being a Scarecrow. For if one has friends near at hand to repair\\r\\ndamages, nothing very serious can happen to you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wonder if hot sunshine is liable to crack pumpkins,” said Jack,\\r\\nwith an anxious ring in his voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not at all—not at all!” replied the Scarecrow, gaily.\\r\\n“All you need fear, my boy, is old age. When your golden youth has\\r\\ndecayed we shall quickly part company—but you needn’t look forward\\r\\nto it; we’ll discover the fact ourselves, and notify you. But come! Let\\r\\nus resume our journey. I am anxious to greet my friend the Tin Woodman.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they remounted the Saw-Horse, Tip holding to the post, the Pumpkinhead\\r\\nclinging to Tip, and the Scarecrow with both arms around the wooden form of\\r\\nJack.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Go slowly, for now there is no danger of pursuit,” said Tip to his\\r\\nsteed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All right!” responded the creature, in a voice rather gruff.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Aren’t you a little hoarse?” asked the Pumpkinhead politely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse gave an angry prance and rolled one knotty eye backward toward\\r\\nTip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“See here,” he growled, “can’t you protect me from\\r\\ninsult?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure!” answered Tip, soothingly. “I am sure Jack meant\\r\\nno harm. And it will not do for us to quarrel, you know; we must all remain\\r\\ngood friends.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll have nothing more to do with that Pumpkinhead,”\\r\\ndeclared the Saw-Horse, viciously. “he loses his head too easily to suit\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere seemed no fitting reply to this speech, so for a time they rode along in\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter a while the Scarecrow remarked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This reminds me of old times. It was upon this grassy knoll that I once\\r\\nsaved Dorothy from the Stinging Bees of the Wicked Witch of the West.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do Stinging Bees injure pumpkins?” asked Jack, glancing around\\r\\nfearfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are all dead, so it doesn’t matter,” replied the\\r\\nScarecrow. “And here is where Nick Chopper destroyed the Wicked\\r\\nWitch’s Grey Wolves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Who was Nick Chopper?” asked Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is the name of my friend the Tin Woodman, answered his Majesty. And\\r\\nhere is where the Winged Monkeys captured and bound us, and flew away with\\r\\nlittle Dorothy,” he continued, after they had traveled a little way\\r\\nfarther.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do Winged Monkeys ever eat pumpkins?” asked Jack, with a shiver of\\r\\nfear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not know; but you have little cause to, worry, for the Winged\\r\\nMonkeys are now the slaves of Glinda the Good, who owns the Golden Cap that\\r\\ncommands their services,” said the Scarecrow, reflectively.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen the stuffed monarch became lost in thought recalling the days of past\\r\\nadventures. And the Saw-Horse rocked and rolled over the flower-strewn fields\\r\\nand carried its riders swiftly upon their way.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTwilight fell, bye and bye, and then the dark shadows of night. So Tip stopped\\r\\nthe horse and they all proceeded to dismount.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m tired out,” said the boy, yawning wearily; “and\\r\\nthe grass is soft and cool. Let us lie down here and sleep until\\r\\nmorning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can’t sleep,” said Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I never do,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not even know what sleep is,” said the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Still, we must have consideration for this poor boy, who is made of\\r\\nflesh and blood and bone, and gets tired,” suggested the Scarecrow, in\\r\\nhis usual thoughtful manner. “I remember it was the same way with little\\r\\nDorothy. We always had to sit through the night while she slept.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m sorry,” said Tip, meekly, “but I can’t help\\r\\nit. And I’m dreadfully hungry, too!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is a new danger!” remarked Jack, gloomily. “I hope you\\r\\nare not fond of eating pumpkins.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not unless they’re stewed and made into pies,” answered the\\r\\nboy, laughing. “So have no fears of me, friend Jack.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What a coward that Pumpkinhead is!” said the Saw-Horse,\\r\\nscornfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You might be a coward yourself, if you knew you were liable to\\r\\nspoil!” retorted Jack, angrily.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There!—there!” interrupted the Scarecrow; “don’t\\r\\nlet us quarrel. We all have our weaknesses, dear friends; so we must strive to\\r\\nbe considerate of one another. And since this poor boy is hungry and has\\r\\nnothing whatever to eat, let us all remain quiet and allow him to sleep; for it\\r\\nis said that in sleep a mortal may forget even hunger.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you!” exclaimed Tip, gratefully. “Your Majesty is\\r\\nfully as good as you are wise—and that is saying a good deal!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe then stretched himself upon the grass and, using the stuffed form of the\\r\\nScarecrow for a pillow, was presently fast asleep.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nA Nickel-Plated Emperor\\n\\r\\nTip awoke soon after dawn, but the Scarecrow had already risen and plucked,\\r\\nwith his clumsy fingers, a double-handful of ripe berries from some bushes near\\r\\nby. These the boy ate greedily, finding them an ample breakfast, and afterward\\r\\nthe little party resumed its Journey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter an hour’s ride they reached the summit of a hill from whence they\\r\\nespied the City of the Winkies and noted the tall domes of the Emperor’s\\r\\npalace rising from the clusters of more modest dwellings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow became greatly animated at this sight, and exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How delighted I shall be to see my old friend the Tin Woodman again! I\\r\\nhope that he rules his people more successfully than I have ruled mine!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is the Tin Woodman the Emperor of the Winkies?” asked the horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes, indeed. They invited him to rule over them soon after the Wicked\\r\\nWitch was destroyed; and as Nick Chopper has the best heart in all the world I\\r\\nam sure he has proved an excellent and able emperor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought that ‘Emperor’ was the title of a person who rules\\r\\nan empire,” said Tip, “and the Country of the Winkies is only a\\r\\nKingdom.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t mention that to the Tin Woodman!” exclaimed the\\r\\nScarecrow, earnestly. “You would hurt his feelings terribly. He is a\\r\\nproud man, as he has every reason to be, and it pleases him to be termed\\r\\nEmperor rather than King.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m sure it makes no difference to me,” replied the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse now ambled forward at a pace so fast that its riders had hard\\r\\nwork to stick upon its back; so there was little further conversation until\\r\\nthey drew up beside the palace steps.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAn aged Winkie, dressed in a uniform of silver cloth, came forward to assist\\r\\nthem to alight. Said the Scarecrow to his personage:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Show us at once to your master, the Emperor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe man looked from one to another of the party in an embarrassed way, and\\r\\nfinally answered:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I fear I must ask you to wait for a time. The Emperor is not receiving\\r\\nthis morning.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How is that?” enquired the Scarecrow, anxiously. “I hope\\r\\nnothing has happened to him.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no; nothing serious,” returned the man. “But this is his\\r\\nMajesty’s day for being polished; and just now his august presence is\\r\\nthickly smeared with putz-pomade.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see!” cried the Scarecrow, greatly reassured. “My\\r\\nfriend was ever inclined to be a dandy, and I suppose he is now more proud than\\r\\never of his personal appearance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He is, indeed,” said the man, with a polite bow. “Our mighty\\r\\nEmperor has lately caused himself to be nickel-plated.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good Gracious!” the Scarecrow exclaimed at hearing this. “If\\r\\nhis wit bears the same polish, how sparkling it must be! But show us\\r\\nin—I’m sure the Emperor will receive us, even in his present\\r\\nstate”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Emperor’s state is always magnificent,” said the man.\\r\\n“But I will venture to tell him of your arrival, and will receive his\\r\\ncommands concerning you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the party followed the servant into a splendid ante-room, and the Saw-Horse\\r\\nambled awkwardly after them, having no knowledge that a horse might be expected\\r\\nto remain outside.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe travelers were at first somewhat awed by their surroundings, and even the\\r\\nScarecrow seemed impressed as he examined the rich hangings of silver cloth\\r\\ncaught up into knots and fastened with tiny silver axes. Upon a handsome\\r\\ncenter-table stood a large silver oil-can, richly engraved with scenes from the\\r\\npast adventures of the Tin Woodman, Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion and the\\r\\nScarecrow: the lines of the engraving being traced upon the silver in yellow\\r\\ngold. On the walls hung several portraits, that of the Scarecrow seeming to be\\r\\nthe most prominent and carefully executed, while a the large painting of the\\r\\nfamous Wizard of Oz, in act of presenting the Tin Woodman with a heart, covered\\r\\nalmost one entire end of the room.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile the visitors gazed at these things in silent admiration they suddenly\\r\\nheard a loud voice in the next room exclaim:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well! well! well! What a great surprise!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd then the door burst open and Nick Chopper rushed into their midst and\\r\\ncaught the Scarecrow in a close and loving embrace that creased him into many\\r\\nfolds and wrinkles.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear old friend! My noble comrade!” cried the Tin Woodman,\\r\\njoyfully. “how delighted! I am to meet you once again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd then he released the Scarecrow and held him at arms’ length while he\\r\\nsurveyed the beloved, painted features.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut, alas! the face of the Scarecrow and many portions of his body bore great\\r\\nblotches of putz-pomade; for the Tin Woodman, in his eagerness to welcome his\\r\\nfriend, had quite forgotten the condition of his toilet and had rubbed the\\r\\nthick coating of paste from his own body to that of his comrade.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear me!” said the Scarecrow dolefully. “What a mess\\r\\nI’m in!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind, my friend,” returned the Tin Woodman,\\r\\n“I’ll send you to my Imperial Laundry, and you’ll come out as\\r\\ngood as new.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Won’t I be mangled?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No, indeed!” was the reply. “But tell me, how came your\\r\\nMajesty here? and who are your companions?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow, with great politeness, introduced Tip and Jack Pumpkinhead, and\\r\\nthe latter personage seemed to interest the Tin Woodman greatly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are not very substantial, I must admit,” said the Emperor.\\r\\n“but you are certainly unusual, and therefore worthy to become a member\\r\\nof our select society.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thank your Majesty,” said Jack, humbly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope you are enjoying good health?” continued the Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At present, yes;” replied the Pumpkinhead, with a sigh; “but\\r\\nI am in constant terror of the day when I shall spoil.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense!” said the Emperor—but in a kindly, sympathetic\\r\\ntone. “Do not, I beg of you, dampen today’s sun with the showers of\\r\\ntomorrow. For before your head has time to spoil you can have it canned, and in\\r\\nthat way it may be preserved indefinitely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip, during this conversation, was looking at the Woodman with undisguised\\r\\namazement, and noticed that the celebrated Emperor of the Winkies was composed\\r\\nentirely of pieces of tin, neatly soldered and riveted together into the form\\r\\nof a man. He rattled and clanked a little, as he moved, but in the main he\\r\\nseemed to be most cleverly constructed, and his appearance was only marred by\\r\\nthe thick coating of polishing-paste that covered him from head to foot.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe boy’s intent gaze caused the Tin Woodman to remember that he was not\\r\\nin the most presentable condition, so he begged his friends to excuse him while\\r\\nhe retired to his private apartment and allowed his servants to polish him.\\r\\nThis was accomplished in a short time, and when the emperor returned his\\r\\nnickel-plated body shone so magnificently that the Scarecrow heartily\\r\\ncongratulated him on his improved appearance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That nickel-plate was, I confess, a happy thought,” said Nick;\\r\\n“and it was the more necessary because I had become somewhat scratched\\r\\nduring my adventurous experiences. You will observe this engraved star upon my\\r\\nleft breast. It not only indicates where my excellent heart lies, but covers\\r\\nvery neatly the patch made by the Wonderful Wizard when he placed that valued\\r\\norgan in my breast with his own skillful hands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is your heart, then, a hand-organ?” asked the Pumpkinhead,\\r\\ncuriously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“By no means,” responded the emperor, with dignity. “It is, I\\r\\nam convinced, a strictly orthodox heart, although somewhat larger and warmer\\r\\nthan most people possess.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen he turned to the Scarecrow and asked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are your subjects happy and contented, my dear friend?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot, say” was the reply. “for the girls of Oz have\\r\\nrisen in revolt and driven me out of the emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Great Goodness!” cried the Tin Woodman, “What a calamity!\\r\\nThey surely do not complain of your wise and gracious rule?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No; but they say it is a poor rule that don’t work both\\r\\nways,” answered the Scarecrow; “and these females are also of the\\r\\nopinion that men have ruled the land long enough. So they have captured my\\r\\ncity, robbed the treasury of all its jewels, and are running things to suit\\r\\nthemselves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear me! What an extraordinary idea!” cried the Emperor, who was\\r\\nboth shocked and surprised.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I heard some of them say,” said Tip, “that they intend\\r\\nto march here and capture the castle and city of the Tin Woodman.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! we must not give them time to do that,” said the Emperor,\\r\\nquickly; “we will go at once and recapture the Emerald City and place the\\r\\nScarecrow again upon his throne.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was sure you would help me,” remarked the Scarecrow in a pleased\\r\\nvoice. “How large an army can you assemble?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We do not need an army,” replied the Woodman. “We four, with\\r\\nthe aid of my gleaming axe, are enough to strike terror into the hearts of the\\r\\nrebels.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We five,” corrected the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Five?” repeated the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; the Saw-Horse is brave and fearless,” answered Jack,\\r\\nforgetting his recent quarrel with the quadruped.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman looked around him in a puzzled way, for the Saw-Horse had until\\r\\nnow remained quietly standing in a corner, where the Emperor had not noticed\\r\\nhim. Tip immediately called the odd-looking creature to them, and it approached\\r\\nso awkwardly that it nearly upset the beautiful center-table and the engraved\\r\\noil-can.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I begin to think,” remarked the Tin Woodman as he looked earnestly\\r\\nat the Saw-Horse, “that wonders will never cease! How came this creature\\r\\nalive?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did it with a magic powder,” modestly asserted the boy.\\r\\n“and the Saw-Horse has been very useful to us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He enabled us to escape the rebels,” added the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then we must surely accept him as a comrade,” declared the\\r\\nemperor. “A live Saw-Horse is a distinct novelty, and should prove an\\r\\ninteresting study. Does he know anything?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, I cannot claim any great experience in life,” the Saw-Horse\\r\\nanswered for himself. “but I seem to learn very quickly, and often it\\r\\noccurs to me that I know more than any of those around me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps you do,” said the emperor; “for experience does not\\r\\nalways mean wisdom. But time is precious just now, so let us quickly make\\r\\npreparations to start upon our Journey.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe emperor called his Lord High Chancellor and instructed him how to run the\\r\\nkingdom during his absence. Meanwhile the Scarecrow was taken apart and the\\r\\npainted sack that served him for a head was carefully laundered and restuffed\\r\\nwith the brains originally given him by the great Wizard. His clothes were also\\r\\ncleaned and pressed by the Imperial tailors, and his crown polished and again\\r\\nsewed upon his head, for the Tin Woodman insisted he should not renounce this\\r\\nbadge of royalty. The Scarecrow now presented a very respectable appearance,\\r\\nand although in no way addicted to vanity he was quite pleased with himself and\\r\\nstrutted a trifle as he walked. While this was being done Tip mended the wooden\\r\\nlimbs of Jack Pumpkinhead and made them stronger than before, and the Saw-Horse\\r\\nwas also inspected to see if he was in good working order.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen bright and early the next morning they set out upon the return Journey to\\r\\nthe emerald City, the Tin Woodman bearing upon his shoulder a gleaming axe and\\r\\nleading the way, while the Pumpkinhead rode upon the Saw-Horse and Tip and the\\r\\nScarecrow walked upon either side to make sure that he didn’t fall off or\\r\\nbecome damaged.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nMr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.\\n\\r\\nNow, General Jinjur—who, you will remember, commanded the Army of\\r\\nRevolt—was rendered very uneasy by the escape of the Scarecrow from the\\r\\nEmerald City. She feared, and with good reason, that if his Majesty and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman Joined forces, it would mean danger to her and her entire army; for the\\r\\npeople of Oz had not yet forgotten the deeds of these famous heroes, who had\\r\\npassed successfully through so many startling adventures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Jinjur sent post-haste for old Mombi, the witch, and promised her large\\r\\nrewards if she would come to the assistance of the rebel army.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi was furious at the trick Tip had played upon her as well as at his escape\\r\\nand the theft of the precious Powder of Life; so she needed no urging to induce\\r\\nher to travel to the Emerald City to assist Jinjur in defeating the Scarecrow\\r\\nand the Tin Woodman, who had made Tip one of their friends.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi had no sooner arrived at the royal palace than she discovered, by means\\r\\nof her secret magic, that the adventurers were starting upon their Journey to\\r\\nthe Emerald City; so she retired to a small room high up in a tower and locked\\r\\nherself in while she practised such arts as she could command to prevent the\\r\\nreturn of the Scarecrow and his companions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat was why the Tin Woodman presently stopped and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Something very curious has happened. I ought to know by heart and every\\r\\nstep of this Journey, yet I fear we have already lost our way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is quite impossible!” protested the Scarecrow. “Why do\\r\\nyou think, my dear friend, that we have gone astray?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, here before us is a great field of sunflowers—and I never saw\\r\\nthis field before in all my life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt these words they all looked around, only to find that they were indeed\\r\\nsurrounded by a field of tall stalks, every stalk bearing at its top a gigantic\\r\\nsunflower. And not only were these flowers almost blinding in their vivid hues\\r\\nof red and gold, but each one whirled around upon its stalk like a miniature\\r\\nwind-mill, completely dazzling the vision of the beholders and so mystifying\\r\\nthem that they knew not which way to turn.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s witchcraft!” exclaimed Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile they paused, hesitating and wondering, the Tin Woodman uttered a cry of\\r\\nimpatience and advanced with swinging axe to cut down the stalks before him.\\r\\nBut now the sunflowers suddenly stopped their rapid whirling, and the travelers\\r\\nplainly saw a girl’s face appear in the center of each flower. These\\r\\nlovely faces looked upon the astonished band with mocking smiles, and then\\r\\nburst into a chorus of merry laughter at the dismay their appearance caused.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stop! stop!” cried Tip, seizing the Woodman’s arm;\\r\\n“they’re alive! they’re girls!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the flowers began whirling again, and the faces faded away and\\r\\nwere lost in the rapid revolutions.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman dropped his axe and sat down upon the ground.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It would be heartless to chop down those pretty creatures,” said\\r\\nhe, despondently. “and yet I do not know how else we can proceed upon our\\r\\nway”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They looked to me strangely like the faces of the Army of Revolt,”\\r\\nmused the Scarecrow. “But I cannot conceive how the girls could have\\r\\nfollowed us here so quickly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe it’s magic,” said Tip, positively, “and that\\r\\nsomeone is playing a trick upon us. I’ve known old Mombi do things like\\r\\nthat before. Probably it’s nothing more than an illusion, and there are\\r\\nno sunflowers here at all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then let us shut our eyes and walk forward,” suggested the\\r\\nWoodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excuse me,” replied the Scarecrow. “My eyes are not painted\\r\\nto shut. Because you happen to have tin eyelids, you must not imagine we are\\r\\nall built in the same way.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And the eyes of the Saw-Horse are knot eyes,” said Jack, leaning\\r\\nforward to examine them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nevertheless, you must ride quickly forward,” commanded Tip,\\r\\n“and we will follow after you and so try to escape. My eyes are already\\r\\nso dazzled that I can scarcely see.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Pumpkinhead rode boldly forward, and Tip grasped the stub tail of the\\r\\nSaw-Horse and followed with closed eyes. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman\\r\\nbrought up the rear, and before they had gone many yards a Joyful shout from\\r\\nJack announced that the way was clear before them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen all paused to look backward, but not a trace of the field of sunflowers\\r\\nremained.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMore cheerfully, now they proceeded upon their Journey; but old Mombi had so\\r\\nchanged the appearance of the landscape that they would surely have been lost\\r\\nhad not the Scarecrow wisely concluded to take their direction from the sun.\\r\\nFor no witch-craft could change the course of the sun, and it was therefore a\\r\\nsafe guide.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHowever, other difficulties lay before them. The Saw-Horse stepped into a\\r\\nrabbit hole and fell to the ground. The Pumpkinhead was pitched high into the\\r\\nair, and his history would probably have ended at that exact moment had not the\\r\\nTin Woodman skillfully caught the pumpkin as it descended and saved it from\\r\\ninjury.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTip soon had it fitted to the neck again and replaced Jack upon his feet. But\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse did not escape so easily. For when his leg was pulled from the\\r\\nrabbit hole it was found to be broken short off, and must be replaced or\\r\\nrepaired before he could go a step farther.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is quite serious,” said the Tin Woodman. “If there were\\r\\ntrees near by I might soon manufacture another leg for this animal; but I\\r\\ncannot see even a shrub for miles around.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And there are neither fences nor houses in this part of the land of\\r\\nOz,” added the Scarecrow, disconsolately.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then what shall we do?” enquired the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I suppose I must start my brains working,” replied his Majesty the\\r\\nScarecrow; “for experience has, taught me that I can do anything if I but\\r\\ntake time to think it out.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us all think,” said Tip; “and perhaps we shall find a\\r\\nway to repair the Saw-Horse.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they sat in a row upon the grass and began to think, while the Saw-Horse\\r\\noccupied itself by gazing curiously upon its broken limb.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Does it hurt?” asked the Tin Woodman, in a soft, sympathetic\\r\\nvoice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not in the least,” returned the Saw-Horse; “but my pride is\\r\\ninjured to find that my anatomy is so brittle.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor a time the little group remained in silent thought. Presently the Tin\\r\\nWoodman raised his head and looked over the fields.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What sort of creature is that which approaches us?” he asked,\\r\\nwonderingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others followed his gaze, and discovered coming toward them the most\\r\\nextraordinary object they had ever beheld. It advanced quickly and noiselessly\\r\\nover the soft grass and in a few minutes stood before the adventurers and\\r\\nregarded them with an astonishment equal to their own.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow was calm under all circumstances.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good morning!” he said, politely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe stranger removed his hat with a flourish, bowed very low, and then\\r\\nresponded:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good morning, one and all. I hope you are, as an aggregation, enjoying\\r\\nexcellent health. Permit me to present my card.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this courteous speech it extended a card toward the Scarecrow, who\\r\\naccepted it, turned it over and over, and handed it with a shake of his head to\\r\\nTip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe boy read aloud:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“MR. H. M. WOGGLE-BUG, T. E.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Dear me!” ejaculated the Pumpkinhead, staring somewhat intently.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How very peculiar!” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip’s eyes were round and wondering, and the Saw-Horse uttered a sigh and\\r\\nturned away its head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you really a Woggle-Bug?” enquired the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Most certainly, my dear sir!” answered the stranger, briskly.\\r\\n“Is not my name upon the card?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is,” said the Scarecrow. “But may I ask what ‘H.\\r\\nM.’ stands for?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘H. M.’ means Highly Magnified,” returned the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug, proudly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see.” The Scarecrow viewed the stranger critically.\\r\\n“And are you, in truth, highly magnified?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Sir,” said the Woggle-Bug, “I take you for a gentleman of\\r\\njudgment and discernment. Does it not occur to you that I am several thousand\\r\\ntimes greater than any Woggle-Bug you ever saw before? Therefore it is plainly\\r\\nevident that I am Highly Magnified, and there is no good reason why you should\\r\\ndoubt the fact.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pardon me,” returned the Scarecrow. “My brains are slightly\\r\\nmixed since I was last laundered. Would it be improper for me to ask, also,\\r\\nwhat the ‘T.E.’ at the end of your name stands for?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Those letters express my degree,” answered the Woggle-Bug, with a\\r\\ncondescending smile. “To be more explicit, the initials mean that I am\\r\\nThoroughly Educated.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh!” said the Scarecrow, much relieved.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip had not yet taken his eyes off this wonderful personage. What he saw was a\\r\\ngreat, round, buglike body supported upon two slender legs which ended in\\r\\ndelicate feet—the toes curling upward. The body of the Woggle-Bug was\\r\\nrather flat, and judging from what could be seen of it was of a glistening dark\\r\\nbrown color upon the back, while the front was striped with alternate bands of\\r\\nlight brown and white, blending together at the edges. Its arms were fully as\\r\\nslender as its legs, and upon a rather long neck was perched its head—not\\r\\nunlike the head of a man, except that its nose ended in a curling antenna, or\\r\\n“feeler,” and its ears from the upper points bore antennae that\\r\\ndecorated the sides of its head like two miniature, curling pig tails. It must\\r\\nbe admitted that the round, black eyes were rather bulging in appearance; but\\r\\nthe expression upon the Woggle-Bug’s face was by no means unpleasant.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor dress the insect wore a dark-blue swallowtail coat with a yellow silk\\r\\nlining and a flower in the button-hole; a vest of white duck that stretched\\r\\ntightly across the wide body; knickerbockers of fawn-colored plush, fastened at\\r\\nthe knees with gilt buckles; and, perched upon its small head, was jauntily set\\r\\na tall silk hat.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nStanding upright before our amazed friends the Woggle-Bug appeared to be fully\\r\\nas tall as the Tin Woodman; and surely no bug in all the Land of Oz had ever\\r\\nbefore attained so enormous a size.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I confess,” said the Scarecrow, “that your abrupt appearance\\r\\nhas caused me surprise, and no doubt has startled my companions. I hope,\\r\\nhowever, that this circumstance will not distress you. We shall probably get\\r\\nused to you in time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not apologize, I beg of you!” returned the Woggle-Bug,\\r\\nearnestly. “It affords me great pleasure to surprise people; for surely I\\r\\ncannot be classed with ordinary insects and am entitled to both curiosity and\\r\\nadmiration from those I meet.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are, indeed,” agreed his Majesty.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you will permit me to seat myself in your august company,”\\r\\ncontinued the stranger, “I will gladly relate my history, so that you\\r\\nwill be better able to comprehend my unusual—may I say\\r\\nremarkable?—appearance.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You may say what you please,” answered the Tin Woodman, briefly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Woggle-Bug sat down upon the grass, facing the little group of\\r\\nwanderers, and told them the following story:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nA Highly Magnified History\\n\\r\\n“It is but honest that I should acknowledge at the beginning of my\\r\\nrecital that I was born an ordinary Woggle-Bug,” began the creature, in a\\r\\nfrank and friendly tone. “Knowing no better, I used my arms as well as my\\r\\nlegs for walking, and crawled under the edges of stones or hid among the roots\\r\\nof grasses with no thought beyond finding a few insects smaller than myself to\\r\\nfeed upon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The chill nights rendered me stiff and motionless, for I wore no\\r\\nclothing, but each morning the warm rays of the sun gave me new life and\\r\\nrestored me to activity. A horrible existence is this, but you must remember it\\r\\nis the regular ordained existence of Woggle-Bugs, as well as of many other tiny\\r\\ncreatures that inhabit the earth.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But Destiny had singled me out, humble though I was, for a grander fate!\\r\\nOne day I crawled near to a country school house, and my curiosity being\\r\\nexcited by the monotonous hum of the students within, I made bold to enter and\\r\\ncreep along a crack between two boards until I reached the far end, where, in\\r\\nfront of a hearth of glowing embers, sat the master at his desk.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No one noticed so small a creature as a Woggle-Bug, and when I found\\r\\nthat the hearth was even warmer and more comfortable than the sunshine, I\\r\\nresolved to establish my future home beside it. So I found a charming nest\\r\\nbetween two bricks and hid myself therein for many, many months.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Professor Nowitall is, doubtless, the most famous scholar in the land of\\r\\nOz, and after a few days I began to listen to the lectures and discourses he\\r\\ngave his pupils. Not one of them was more attentive than the humble, unnoticed\\r\\nWoggle-Bug, and I acquired in this way a fund of knowledge that I will myself\\r\\nconfess is simply marvelous. That is why I place ‘T.E.’ Thoroughly\\r\\nEducated upon my cards; for my greatest pride lies in the fact that the world\\r\\ncannot produce another Woggle-Bug with a tenth part of my own culture and\\r\\nerudition.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not blame you,” said the Scarecrow. “Education is a\\r\\nthing to be proud of. I’m educated myself. The mess of brains given me by\\r\\nthe Great Wizard is considered by my friends to be unexcelled.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nevertheless,” interrupted the Tin Woodman, “a good heart\\r\\nis, I believe, much more desirable than education or brains.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To me,” said the Saw-Horse, “a good leg is more desirable\\r\\nthan either.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Could seeds be considered in the light of brains?” enquired the\\r\\nPumpkinhead, abruptly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Keep quiet!” commanded Tip, sternly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well, dear father,” answered the obedient Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug listened patiently—even respectfully—to these\\r\\nremarks, and then resumed his story.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must have lived fully three years in that secluded school-house\\r\\nhearth,” said he, “drinking thirstily of the ever-flowing fount of\\r\\nlimpid knowledge before me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Quite poetical,” commented the Scarecrow, nodding his head\\r\\napprovingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But one, day” continued the Bug, “a marvelous circumstance\\r\\noccurred that altered my very existence and brought me to my present pinnacle\\r\\nof greatness. The Professor discovered me in the act of crawling across the\\r\\nhearth, and before I could escape he had caught me between his thumb and\\r\\nforefinger.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘My dear children,’ said he, ‘I have captured a\\r\\nWoggle-Bug—a very rare and interesting specimen. Do any of you know what\\r\\na Woggle-Bug is?’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘No!’ yelled the scholars, in chorus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Then,’ said the Professor, ‘I will get out my famous\\r\\nmagnifying-glass and throw the insect upon a screen in a highly-magnified\\r\\ncondition, that you may all study carefully its peculiar construction and\\r\\nbecome acquainted with its habits and manner of life.’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He then brought from a cupboard a most curious instrument, and before I\\r\\ncould realize what had happened I found myself thrown upon a screen in a\\r\\nhighly-magnified state—even as you now behold me.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“The students stood up on their stools and craned their heads forward to\\r\\nget a better view of me, and two little girls jumped upon the sill of an open\\r\\nwindow where they could see more plainly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“‘Behold!’ cried the Professor, in a loud voice, ‘this\\r\\nhighly-magnified Woggle-Bug; one of the most curious insects in\\r\\nexistence!’\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Being Thoroughly Educated, and knowing what is required of a cultured\\r\\ngentleman, at this juncture I stood upright and, placing my hand upon my bosom,\\r\\nmade a very polite bow. My action, being unexpected, must have startled them,\\r\\nfor one of the little girls perched upon the window-sill gave a scream and fell\\r\\nbackward out the window, drawing her companion with her as she disappeared.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Professor uttered a cry of horror and rushed away through the door\\r\\nto see if the poor children were injured by the fall. The scholars followed\\r\\nafter him in a wild mob, and I was left alone in the school-room, still in a\\r\\nHighly-Magnified state and free to do as I pleased.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It immediately occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to\\r\\nescape. I was proud of my great size, and realized that now I could safely\\r\\ntravel anywhere in the world, while my superior culture would make me a fit\\r\\nassociate for the most learned person I might chance to meet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“So, while the Professor picked the little girls—who were more\\r\\nfrightened than hurt—off the ground, and the pupils clustered around him\\r\\nclosely grouped, I calmly walked out of the school-house, turned a corner, and\\r\\nescaped unnoticed to a grove of trees that stood near”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Wonderful!” exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, admiringly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was, indeed,” agreed the Woggle-Bug. “I have never ceased\\r\\nto congratulate myself for escaping while I was Highly Magnified; for even my\\r\\nexcessive knowledge would have proved of little use to me had I remained a\\r\\ntiny, insignificant insect.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“I didn’t know before,” said Tip, looking at the Woggle-Bug\\r\\nwith a puzzled expression, “that insects wore clothes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nor do they, in their natural state,” returned the stranger.\\r\\n“But in the course of my wanderings I had the good fortune to save the\\r\\nninth life of a tailor—tailors having, like cats, nine lives, as you\\r\\nprobably know. The fellow was exceedingly grateful, for had he lost that ninth\\r\\nlife it would have been the end of him; so he begged permission to furnish me\\r\\nwith the stylish costume I now wear. It fits very nicely, does it not?”\\r\\nand the Woggle-Bug stood up and turned himself around slowly, that all might\\r\\nexamine his person.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He must have been a good tailor,” said the Scarecrow, somewhat\\r\\nenviously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He was a good-hearted tailor, at any rate,” observed Nick Chopper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But where were you going, when you met us?” Tip asked the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nowhere in particular,” was the reply, “although it is my\\r\\nintention soon to visit the Emerald City and arrange to give a course of\\r\\nlectures to select audiences on the ‘Advantages of\\r\\nMagnification.’”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are bound for the Emerald City now,” said the Tin Woodman;\\r\\n“so, if it pleases you to do so, you are welcome to travel in our\\r\\ncompany.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug bowed with profound grace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It will give me great pleasure,” said he “to accept your\\r\\nkind invitation; for nowhere in the Land of Oz could I hope to meet with so\\r\\ncongenial a company.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” acknowledged the Pumpkinhead. “We are quite\\r\\nas congenial as flies and honey.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But—pardon me if I seem inquisitive—are you not all\\r\\nrather—ahem! rather unusual?” asked the Woggle-Bug, looking from\\r\\none to another with unconcealed interest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not more so than yourself,” answered the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“Everything in life is unusual until you get accustomed to it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What rare philosophy!” exclaimed the Woggle-Bug, admiringly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; my brains are working well today,” admitted the Scarecrow, an\\r\\naccent of pride in his voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then, if you are sufficiently rested and refreshed, let us bend our\\r\\nsteps toward the Emerald City,” suggested the magnified one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We can’t,” said Tip. “The Saw-Horse has broken a leg,\\r\\nso he can’t bend his steps. And there is no wood around to make him a new\\r\\nlimb from. And we can’t leave the horse behind because the Pumpkinhead is\\r\\nso stiff in his Joints that he has to ride.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How very unfortunate!” cried the Woggle-Bug. Then he looked the\\r\\nparty over carefully and said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If the Pumpkinhead is to ride, why not use one of his legs to make a leg\\r\\nfor the horse that carries him? I judge that both are made of wood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now, that is what I call real cleverness,” said the Scarecrow,\\r\\napprovingly. “I wonder my brains did not think of that long ago! Get to\\r\\nwork, my dear Nick, and fit the Pumpkinhead’s leg to the\\r\\nSaw-Horse.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack was not especially pleased with this idea; but he submitted to having his\\r\\nleft leg amputated by the Tin Woodman and whittled down to fit the left leg of\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse. Nor was the Saw-Horse especially pleased with the operation,\\r\\neither; for he growled a good deal about being “butchered,” as he\\r\\ncalled it, and afterward declared that the new leg was a disgrace to a\\r\\nrespectable Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg you to be more careful in your speech,” said the\\r\\nPumpkinhead, sharply. “Remember, if you please, that it is my leg you are\\r\\nabusing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I cannot forget it,” retorted the Saw-Horse, “for it is\\r\\nquite as flimsy as the rest of your person.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Flimsy! me flimsy!” cried Jack, in a rage. “How dare you\\r\\ncall me flimsy?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because you are built as absurdly as a jumping-jack,” sneered the\\r\\nhorse, rolling his knotty eyes in a vicious manner. “Even your head\\r\\nwon’t stay straight, and you never can tell whether you are looking\\r\\nbackwards or forwards!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Friends, I entreat you not to quarrel!” pleaded the Tin Woodman,\\r\\nanxiously. “As a matter of fact, we are none of us above criticism; so\\r\\nlet us bear with each others’ faults.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An excellent suggestion,” said the Woggle-Bug, approvingly.\\r\\n“You must have an excellent heart, my metallic friend.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have,” returned Nick, well pleased. “My heart is quite the\\r\\nbest part of me. But now let us start upon our Journey.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey perched the one-legged Pumpkinhead upon the Saw-Horse, and tied him to his\\r\\nseat with cords, so that he could not possibly fall off.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd then, following the lead of the Scarecrow, they all advanced in the\\r\\ndirection of the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nOld Mombi indulges in Witchcraft\\n\\r\\nThey soon discovered that the Saw-Horse limped, for his new leg was a trifle\\r\\ntoo long. So they were obliged to halt while the Tin Woodman chopped it down\\r\\nwith his axe, after which the wooden steed paced along more comfortably. But\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse was not entirely satisfied, even yet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It was a shame that I broke my other leg!” it growled.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“On the contrary,” airily remarked the Woggle-Bug, who was walking\\r\\nalongside, “you should consider the accident most fortunate. For a horse\\r\\nis never of much use until he has been broken.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg your pardon,” said Tip, rather provoked, for he felt a warm\\r\\ninterest in both the Saw-Horse and his man Jack; “but permit me to say\\r\\nthat your joke is a poor one, and as old as it is poor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Still, it is a Joke,” declared the Woggle-Bug; firmly, “and\\r\\na Joke derived from a play upon words is considered among educated people to be\\r\\neminently proper.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What does that mean?” enquired the Pumpkinhead, stupidly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It means, my dear friend,” explained the Woggle-Bug, “that\\r\\nour language contains many words having a double meaning; and that to pronounce\\r\\na joke that allows both meanings of a certain word, proves the joker a person\\r\\nof culture and refinement, who has, moreover, a thorough command of the\\r\\nlanguage.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t believe that,” said Tip, plainly; “anybody can\\r\\nmake a pun.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not so,” rejoined the Woggle-Bug, stiffly. “It requires\\r\\neducation of a high order. Are you educated, young sir?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not especially,” admitted Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you cannot judge the matter. I myself am Thoroughly Educated, and I\\r\\nsay that puns display genius. For instance, were I to ride upon this Saw-Horse,\\r\\nhe would not only be an animal he would become an equipage. For he would then\\r\\nbe a horse-and-buggy.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this the Scarecrow gave a gasp and the Tin Woodman stopped short and looked\\r\\nreproachfully at the Woggle-Bug. At the same time the Saw-Horse loudly snorted\\r\\nhis derision; and even the Pumpkinhead put up his hand to hide the smile which,\\r\\nbecause it was carved upon his face, he could not change to a frown.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Woggle-Bug strutted along as if he had made some brilliant remark, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow was obliged to say:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have heard, my dear friend, that a person can become over-educated;\\r\\nand although I have a high respect for brains, no matter how they may be\\r\\narranged or classified, I begin to suspect that yours are slightly tangled. In\\r\\nany event, I must beg you to restrain your superior education while in our\\r\\nsociety.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are not very particular,” added the Tin Woodman; “and we\\r\\nare exceedingly kind hearted. But if your superior culture gets leaky\\r\\nagain—” He did not complete the sentence, but he twirled his\\r\\ngleaming axe so carelessly that the Woggle-Bug looked frightened, and shrank\\r\\naway to a safe distance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others marched on in silence, and the Highly Magnified one, after a period\\r\\nof deep thought, said in an humble voice:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will endeavor to restrain myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is all we can expect,” returned the Scarecrow pleasantly; and\\r\\ngood nature being thus happily restored to the party, they proceeded upon their\\r\\nway.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen they again stopped to allow Tip to rest—the boy being the only one\\r\\nthat seemed to tire—the Tin Woodman noticed many small, round holes in\\r\\nthe grassy meadow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This must be a village of the Field Mice,” he said to the\\r\\nScarecrow. “I wonder if my old friend, the Queen of the Mice, is in this\\r\\nneighborhood.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If she is, she may be of great service to us,” answered the\\r\\nScarecrow, who was impressed by a sudden thought. “See if you can call\\r\\nher, my dear Nick.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Tin Woodman blew a shrill note upon a silver whistle that hung around\\r\\nhis neck, and presently a tiny grey mouse popped from a near-by hole and\\r\\nadvanced fearlessly toward them. For the Tin Woodman had once saved her life,\\r\\nand the Queen of the Field Mice knew he was to be trusted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good day, your Majesty,” said Nick, politely addressing the mouse;\\r\\n“I trust you are enjoying good health?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, I am quite well,” answered the Queen, demurely, as she\\r\\nsat up and displayed the tiny golden crown upon her head. “Can I do\\r\\nanything to assist my old friends?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You can, indeed,” replied the Scarecrow, eagerly. “Let me, I\\r\\nintreat you, take a dozen of your subjects with me to the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Will they be injured in any way?” asked the Queen, doubtfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think not,” replied the Scarecrow. “I will carry them\\r\\nhidden in the straw which stuffs my body, and when I give them the signal by\\r\\nunbuttoning my jacket, they have only to rush out and scamper home again as\\r\\nfast as they can. By doing this they will assist me to regain my throne, which\\r\\nthe Army of Revolt has taken from me.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In that case,” said the Queen, “I will not refuse your\\r\\nrequest. Whenever you are ready, I will call twelve of my most intelligent\\r\\nsubjects.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am ready now” returned the Scarecrow. Then he lay flat upon the\\r\\nground and unbuttoned his jacket, displaying the mass of straw with which he\\r\\nwas stuffed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Queen uttered a little piping call, and in an instant a dozen pretty field\\r\\nmice had emerged from their holes and stood before their ruler, awaiting her\\r\\norders.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nWhat the Queen said to them none of our travelers could understand, for it was\\r\\nin the mouse language; but the field mice obeyed without hesitation, running\\r\\none after the other to the Scarecrow and hiding themselves in the straw of his\\r\\nbreast.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen all of the twelve mice had thus concealed themselves, the Scarecrow\\r\\nbuttoned his Jacket securely and then arose and thanked the Queen for her\\r\\nkindness.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One thing more you might do to serve us,” suggested the Tin\\r\\nWoodman; “and that is to run ahead and show us the way to the Emerald\\r\\nCity. For some enemy is evidently trying to prevent us from reaching it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will do that gladly,” returned the Queen. “Are you\\r\\nready?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman looked at Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m rested,” said the boy. “Let us start.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen they resumed their journey, the little grey Queen of the Field Mice\\r\\nrunning swiftly ahead and then pausing until the travelers drew near, when away\\r\\nshe would dart again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWithout this unerring guide the Scarecrow and his comrades might never have\\r\\ngained the Emerald City; for many were the obstacles thrown in their way by the\\r\\narts of old Mombi. Yet not one of the obstacles really existed—all were\\r\\ncleverly contrived deceptions. For when they came to the banks of a rushing\\r\\nriver that threatened to bar their way the little Queen kept steadily on,\\r\\npassing through the seeming flood in safety; and our travelers followed her\\r\\nwithout encountering a single drop of water.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAgain, a high wall of granite towered high above their heads and opposed their\\r\\nadvance. But the grey Field Mouse walked straight through it, and the others\\r\\ndid the same, the wall melting into mist as they passed it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfterward, when they had stopped for a moment to allow Tip to rest, they saw\\r\\nforty roads branching off from their feet in forty different directions; and\\r\\nsoon these forty roads began whirling around like a mighty wheel, first in one\\r\\ndirection and then in the other, completely bewildering their vision.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Queen called for them to follow her and darted off in a straight line;\\r\\nand when they had gone a few paces the whirling pathways vanished and were seen\\r\\nno more.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi’s last trick was the most fearful of all. She sent a sheet of\\r\\ncrackling flame rushing over the meadow to consume them; and for the first time\\r\\nthe Scarecrow became afraid and turned to fly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If that fire reaches me I will be gone in no time!” said he,\\r\\ntrembling until his straw rattled. “It’s the most dangerous thing I\\r\\never encountered.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m off, too!” cried the Saw-Horse, turning and prancing\\r\\nwith agitation; “for my wood is so dry it would burn like\\r\\nkindlings.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is fire dangerous to pumpkins?” asked Jack, fearfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’ll be baked like a tart—and so will I!” answered\\r\\nthe Woggle-Bug, getting down on all fours so he could run the faster.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman, having no fear of fire, averted the stampede by a few\\r\\nsensible words.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look at the Field Mouse!” he shouted. “The fire does not\\r\\nburn her in the least. In fact, it is no fire at all, but only a\\r\\ndeception.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIndeed, to watch the little Queen march calmly through the advancing flames\\r\\nrestored courage to every member of the party, and they followed her without\\r\\nbeing even scorched.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is surely a most extraordinary adventure,” said the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug, who was greatly amazed; “for it upsets all the Natural Laws\\r\\nthat I heard Professor Nowitall teach in the school-house.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course it does,” said the Scarecrow, wisely. “All magic\\r\\nis unnatural, and for that reason is to be feared and avoided. But I see before\\r\\nus the gates of the Emerald City, so I imagine we have now overcome all the\\r\\nmagical obstacles that seemed to oppose us.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the walls of the City were plainly visible, and the Queen of the Field\\r\\nMice, who had guided them so faithfully, came near to bid them good-bye.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are very grateful to your Majesty for your kind assistance,”\\r\\nsaid the Tin Woodman, bowing before the pretty creature.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am always pleased to be of service to my friends,” answered the\\r\\nQueen, and in a flash she had darted away upon her journey home.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Prisoners of the Queen\\n\\r\\nApproaching the gateway of the Emerald City the travelers found it guarded by\\r\\ntwo girls of the Army of Revolt, who opposed their entrance by drawing the\\r\\nknitting-needles from their hair and threatening to prod the first that came\\r\\nnear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman was not afraid.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At the worst they can but scratch my beautiful nickel-plate,” he\\r\\nsaid. “But there will be no ‘worst,’ for I think I can manage\\r\\nto frighten these absurd soldiers very easily. Follow me closely, all of\\r\\nyou!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, swinging his axe in a great circle to right and left before him, he\\r\\nadvanced upon the gate, and the others followed him without hesitation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe girls, who had expected no resistance whatever, were terrified by the sweep\\r\\nof the glittering axe and fled screaming into the city; so that our travelers\\r\\npassed the gates in safety and marched down the green marble pavement of the\\r\\nwide street toward the royal palace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At this rate we will soon have your Majesty upon the throne\\r\\nagain,” said the Tin Woodman, laughing at his easy conquest of the\\r\\nguards.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you, friend Nick,” returned the Scarecrow, gratefully.\\r\\n“Nothing can resist your kind heart and your sharp axe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs they passed the rows of houses they saw through the open doors that men were\\r\\nsweeping and dusting and washing dishes, while the women sat around in groups,\\r\\ngossiping and laughing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What has happened?” the Scarecrow asked a sad-looking man with a\\r\\nbushy beard, who wore an apron and was wheeling a baby-carriage along the\\r\\nsidewalk.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, we’ve had a revolution, your Majesty as you ought to know\\r\\nvery well,” replied the man; “and since you went away the women\\r\\nhave been running things to suit themselves. I’m glad you have decided to\\r\\ncome back and restore order, for doing housework and minding the children is\\r\\nwearing out the strength of every man in the Emerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hm!” said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully. “If it is such hard\\r\\nwork as you say, how did the women manage it so easily?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I really do not know” replied the man, with a deep sigh.\\r\\n“Perhaps the women are made of castiron.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo movement was made, as they passed along the street, to oppose their\\r\\nprogress. Several of the women stopped their gossip long enough to cast curious\\r\\nlooks upon our friends, but immediately they would turn away with a laugh or a\\r\\nsneer and resume their chatter. And when they met with several girls belonging\\r\\nto the Army of Revolt, those soldiers, instead of being alarmed or appearing\\r\\nsurprised, merely stepped out of the way and allowed them to advance without\\r\\nprotest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis action rendered the Scarecrow uneasy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid we are walking into a trap,” said he.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense!” returned Nick Chopper, confidently; “the silly\\r\\ncreatures are conquered already!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Scarecrow shook his head in a way that expressed doubt, and Tip said:\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s too easy, altogether. Look out for trouble ahead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will,” returned his Majesty. Unopposed they reached the royal\\r\\npalace and marched up the marble steps, which had once been thickly crusted\\r\\nwith emeralds but were now filled with tiny holes where the jewels had been\\r\\nruthlessly torn from their settings by the Army of Revolt. And so far not a\\r\\nrebel barred their way.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThrough the arched hallways and into the magnificent throne room marched the\\r\\nTin Woodman and his followers, and here, when the green silken curtains fell\\r\\nbehind them, they saw a curious sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSeated within the glittering throne was General Jinjur, with the\\r\\nScarecrow’s second-best crown upon her head, and the royal sceptre in her\\r\\nright hand. A box of caramels, from which she was eating, rested in her lap,\\r\\nand the girl seemed entirely at ease in her royal surroundings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow stepped forward and confronted her, while the Tin Woodman leaned\\r\\nupon his axe and the others formed a half-circle back of his Majesty’s\\r\\nperson.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How dare you sit in my throne?” demanded the Scarecrow, sternly\\r\\neyeing the intruder. “Don’t you know you are guilty of treason, and\\r\\nthat there is a law against treason?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The throne belongs to whoever is able to take it,” answered\\r\\nJinjur, as she slowly ate another caramel. “I have taken it, as you see;\\r\\nso just now I am the Queen, and all who oppose me are guilty of treason, and\\r\\nmust be punished by the law you have just mentioned.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis view of the case puzzled the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How is it, friend Nick?” he asked, turning to the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, when it comes to Law, I have nothing to, say” answered that\\r\\npersonage. “for laws were never meant to be understood, and it is foolish\\r\\nto make the attempt.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then what shall we do?” asked the Scarecrow, in dismay.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you marry the Queen? And then you can both rule,”\\r\\nsuggested the Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJinjur glared at the insect fiercely. “Why don’t you send her back\\r\\nto her mother, where she belongs?” asked Jack Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJinjur frowned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why don’t you shut her up in a closet until she behaves herself,\\r\\nand promises to be good?” enquired Tip. Jinjur’s lip curled\\r\\nscornfully.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or give her a good shaking!” added the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” said the Tin Woodman, “we must treat the poor girl with\\r\\ngentleness. Let us give her all the Jewels she can carry, and send her away\\r\\nhappy and contented.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this Queen Jinjur laughed aloud, and the next minute clapped her pretty\\r\\nhands together thrice, as if for a signal.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are very absurd creatures,” said she; “but I am tired of\\r\\nyour nonsense and have no time to bother with you longer.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile the monarch and his friends listened in amazement to this impudent\\r\\nspeech, a startling thing happened. The Tin Woodman’s axe was snatched\\r\\nfrom his grasp by some person behind him, and he found himself disarmed and\\r\\nhelpless. At the same instant a shout of laughter rang in the ears of the\\r\\ndevoted band, and turning to see whence this came they found themselves\\r\\nsurrounded by the Army of Revolt, the girls bearing in either hand their\\r\\nglistening knitting-needles. The entire throne room seemed to be filled with\\r\\nthe rebels, and the Scarecrow and his comrades realized that they were\\r\\nprisoners.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You see how foolish it is to oppose a woman’s wit,” said\\r\\nJinjur, gaily; “and this event only proves that I am more fit to rule the\\r\\nEmerald City than a Scarecrow. I bear you no ill will, I assure you; but lest\\r\\nyou should prove troublesome to me in the future I shall order you all to be\\r\\ndestroyed. That is, all except the boy, who belongs to old Mombi and must be\\r\\nrestored to her keeping. The rest of you are not human, and therefore it will\\r\\nnot be wicked to demolish you. The Saw-Horse and the Pumpkinhead’s body I\\r\\nwill have chopped up for kindling-wood; and the pumpkin shall be made into\\r\\ntarts. The Scarecrow will do nicely to start a bonfire, and the tin man can be\\r\\ncut into small pieces and fed to the goats. As for this immense\\r\\nWoggle-Bug—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Highly Magnified, if you please!” interrupted the insect.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think I will ask the cook to make green-turtle soup of you,”\\r\\ncontinued the Queen, reflectively.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug shuddered.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or, if that won’t do, we might use you for a Hungarian goulash,\\r\\nstewed and highly spiced,” she added, cruelly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis programme of extermination was so terrible that the prisoners looked upon\\r\\none another in a panic of fear. The Scarecrow alone did not give way to\\r\\ndespair. He stood quietly before the Queen and his brow was wrinkled in deep\\r\\nthought as he strove to find some means to escape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile thus engaged he felt the straw within his breast move gently. At once his\\r\\nexpression changed from sadness to joy, and raising his hand he quickly\\r\\nunbuttoned the front of his jacket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis action did not pass unnoticed by the crowd of girls clustering about him,\\r\\nbut none of them suspected what he was doing until a tiny grey mouse leaped\\r\\nfrom his bosom to the floor and scampered away between the feet of the Army of\\r\\nRevolt. Another mouse quickly followed; then another and another, in rapid\\r\\nsuccession. And suddenly such a scream of terror went up from the Army that it\\r\\nmight easily have filled the stoutest heart with consternation. The flight that\\r\\nensued turned to a stampede, and the stampede to a panic.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor while the startled mice rushed wildly about the room the Scarecrow had only\\r\\ntime to note a whirl of skirts and a twinkling of feet as the girls disappeared\\r\\nfrom the palace—pushing and crowding one another in their mad efforts to\\r\\nescape.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Queen, at the first alarm, stood up on the cushions of the throne and began\\r\\nto dance frantically upon her tiptoes. Then a mouse ran up the cushions, and\\r\\nwith a terrified leap poor Jinjur shot clear over the head of the Scarecrow and\\r\\nescaped through an archway—never pausing in her wild career until she had\\r\\nreached the city gates.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, in less time than I can explain, the throne room was deserted by all save\\r\\nthe Scarecrow and his friends, and the Woggle-Bug heaved a deep sigh of relief\\r\\nas he exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank goodness, we are saved!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For a time, yes;” answered the Tin Woodman. “But the enemy\\r\\nwill soon return, I fear.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us bar all the entrances to the palace!” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“Then we shall have time to think what is best to be done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo all except Jack Pumpkinhead, who was still tied fast to the Saw-Horse, ran\\r\\nto the various entrances of the royal palace and closed the heavy doors,\\r\\nbolting and locking them securely. Then, knowing that the Army of Revolt could\\r\\nnot batter down the barriers in several days, the adventurers gathered once\\r\\nmore in the throne room for a council of war.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow Takes Time to Think\\n\\r\\n“It seems to me,” began the Scarecrow, when all were again\\r\\nassembled in the throne room, “that the girl Jinjur is quite right in\\r\\nclaiming to be Queen. And if she is right, then I am wrong, and we have no\\r\\nbusiness to be occupying her palace.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you were the King until she came,” said the Woggle-Bug,\\r\\nstrutting up and down with his hands in his pockets; “so it appears to me\\r\\nthat she is the interloper instead of you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Especially as we have just conquered her and put her to flight,”\\r\\nadded the Pumpkinhead, as he raised his hands to turn his face toward the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have we really conquered her?” asked the Scarecrow, quietly.\\r\\n“Look out of the window, and tell me what you see.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip ran to the window and looked out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The palace is surrounded by a double row of girl soldiers,” he\\r\\nannounced.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I thought so,” returned the Scarecrow. “We are as truly\\r\\ntheir prisoners as we were before the mice frightened them from the\\r\\npalace.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My friend is right,” said Nick Chopper, who had been polishing his\\r\\nbreast with a bit of chamois-leather. “Jinjur is still the Queen, and we\\r\\nare her prisoners.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I hope she cannot get at us,” exclaimed the Pumpkinhead, with\\r\\na shiver of fear. “She threatened to make tarts of me, you know.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t worry,” said the Tin Woodman. “It cannot matter\\r\\ngreatly. If you stay shut up here you will spoil in time, anyway. A good tart\\r\\nis far more admirable than a decayed intellect.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very true,” agreed the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, dear!” moaned Jack; “what an unhappy lot is mine! Why,\\r\\ndear father, did you not make me out of tin—or even out of straw—so\\r\\nthat I would keep indefinitely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Shucks!” returned Tip, indignantly. “You ought to be glad\\r\\nthat I made you at all.” Then he added, reflectively, “everything\\r\\nhas to come to an end, some time.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I beg to remind you,” broke in the Woggle-Bug, who had a\\r\\ndistressed look in his bulging, round eyes, “that this terrible Queen\\r\\nJinjur suggested making a goulash of me—Me! the only Highly Magnified and\\r\\nThoroughly Educated Woggle-Bug in the wide, wide world!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think it was a brilliant idea,” remarked the Scarecrow,\\r\\napprovingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you imagine he would make a better soup?” asked the\\r\\nTin Woodman, turning toward his friend.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, perhaps,” acknowledged the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug groaned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can see, in my mind’s eye,” said he, mournfully,\\r\\n“the goats eating small pieces of my dear comrade, the Tin Woodman, while\\r\\nmy soup is being cooked on a bonfire built of the Saw-Horse and Jack\\r\\nPumpkinhead’s body, and Queen Jinjur watches me boil while she feeds the\\r\\nflames with my friend the Scarecrow!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThis morbid picture cast a gloom over the entire party, making them restless\\r\\nand anxious.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It can’t happen for some time,” said the Tin Woodman, trying\\r\\nto speak cheerfully; “for we shall be able to keep Jinjur out of the\\r\\npalace until she manages to break down the doors.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And in the meantime I am liable to starve to death, and so is the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug,” announced Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As for me,” said the Woggle-Bug, “I think that I could live\\r\\nfor some time on Jack Pumpkinhead. Not that I prefer pumpkins for food; but I\\r\\nbelieve they are somewhat nutritious, and Jack’s head is large and\\r\\nplump.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How heartless!” exclaimed the Tin Woodman, greatly shocked.\\r\\n“Are we cannibals, let me ask? Or are we faithful friends?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see very clearly that we cannot stay shut up in this palace,”\\r\\nsaid the Scarecrow, with decision. “So let us end this mournful talk and\\r\\ntry to discover a means to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this suggestion they all gathered eagerly around the throne, wherein was\\r\\nseated the Scarecrow, and as Tip sat down upon a stool there fell from his\\r\\npocket a pepper-box, which rolled upon the floor.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is this?” asked Nick Chopper, picking up the box.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be careful!” cried the boy. “That’s my Powder of Life.\\r\\nDon’t spill it, for it is nearly gone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And what is the Powder of Life?” enquired the Scarecrow, as Tip\\r\\nreplaced the box carefully in his pocket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s some magical stuff old Mombi got from a crooked\\r\\nsorcerer,” explained the boy. “She brought Jack to life with it,\\r\\nand afterward I used it to bring the Saw-Horse to life. I guess it will make\\r\\nanything live that is sprinkled with it; but there’s only about one dose\\r\\nleft.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then it is very precious,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed it is,” agreed the Scarecrow. “It may prove our best\\r\\nmeans of escape from our difficulties. I believe I will think for a few\\r\\nminutes; so I will thank you, friend Tip, to get out your knife and rip this\\r\\nheavy crown from my forehead.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip soon cut the stitches that had fastened the crown to the Scarecrow’s\\r\\nhead, and the former monarch of the Emerald City removed it with a sigh of\\r\\nrelief and hung it on a peg beside the throne.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is my last memento of royalty” said he; “and I’m\\r\\nglad to get rid of it. The former King of this City, who was named Pastoria,\\r\\nlost the crown to the Wonderful Wizard, who passed it on to me. Now the girl\\r\\nJinjur claims it, and I sincerely hope it will not give her a headache.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A kindly thought, which I greatly admire,” said the Tin Woodman,\\r\\nnodding approvingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And now I will indulge in a quiet think,” continued the Scarecrow,\\r\\nlying back in the throne.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others remained as silent and still as possible, so as not to disturb him;\\r\\nfor all had great confidence in the extraordinary brains of the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd, after what seemed a very long time indeed to the anxious watchers, the\\r\\nthinker sat up, looked upon his friends with his most whimsical expression, and\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My brains work beautifully today. I’m quite proud of them. Now,\\r\\nlisten! If we attempt to escape through the doors of the palace we shall surely\\r\\nbe captured. And, as we can’t escape through the ground, there is only\\r\\none other thing to be done. We must escape through the air!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe paused to note the effect of these words; but all his hearers seemed puzzled\\r\\nand unconvinced.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Wonderful Wizard escaped in a balloon,” he continued.\\r\\n“We don’t know how to make a balloon, of course; but any sort of\\r\\nthing that can fly through the air can carry us easily. So I suggest that my\\r\\nfriend the Tin Woodman, who is a skillful mechanic, shall build some sort of a\\r\\nmachine, with good strong wings, to carry us; and our friend Tip can then bring\\r\\nthe Thing to life with his magical powder.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Bravo!” cried Nick Chopper.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What splendid brains!” murmured Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really quite clever!” said the Educated Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I believe it can be done,” declared Tip; “that is, if the\\r\\nTin Woodman is equal to making the Thing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll do my best,” said Nick, cheerily; “and, as a\\r\\nmatter of fact, I do not often fail in what I attempt. But the Thing will have\\r\\nto be built on the roof of the palace, so it can rise comfortably into the\\r\\nair.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then let us search through the palace,” continued the Tin Woodman,\\r\\n“and carry all the material we can find to the roof, where I will begin\\r\\nmy work.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“First, however,” said the Pumpkinhead, “I beg you will\\r\\nrelease me from this horse, and make me another leg to walk with. For in my\\r\\npresent condition I am of no use to myself or to anyone else.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the Tin Woodman knocked a mahogany center-table to pieces with his axe and\\r\\nfitted one of the legs, which was beautifully carved, on to the body of Jack\\r\\nPumpkinhead, who was very proud of the acquisition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It seems strange,” said he, as he watched the Tin Woodman work,\\r\\n“that my left leg should be the most elegant and substantial part of\\r\\nme.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That proves you are unusual,” returned the Scarecrow. “and I\\r\\nam convinced that the only people worthy of consideration in this world are the\\r\\nunusual ones. For the common folks are like the leaves of a tree, and live and\\r\\ndie unnoticed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Spoken like a philosopher!” cried the Woggle-Bug, as he assisted\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman to set Jack upon his feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How do you feel now?” asked Tip, watching the Pumpkinhead stump\\r\\naround to try his new leg.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“As good as new” answered Jack, joyfully, “and quite ready to\\r\\nassist you all to escape.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then let us get to work,” said the Scarecrow, in a business-like\\r\\ntone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo, glad to be doing anything that might lead to the end of their captivity,\\r\\nthe friends separated to wander over the palace in search of fitting material\\r\\nto use in the construction of their aerial machine.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Astonishing Flight of the Gump\\n\\r\\nWhen the adventurers reassembled upon the roof it was found that a remarkably\\r\\nqueer assortment of articles had been selected by the various members of the\\r\\nparty. No one seemed to have a very clear idea of what was required, but all\\r\\nhad brought something.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug had taken from its position over the mantle-piece in the great\\r\\nhallway the head of a Gump, which was adorned with wide-spreading antlers; and\\r\\nthis, with great care and greater difficulty, the insect had carried up the\\r\\nstairs to the roof. This Gump resembled an Elk’s head, only the nose\\r\\nturned upward in a saucy manner and there were whiskers upon its chin, like\\r\\nthose of a billy-goat. Why the Woggle-Bug selected this article he could not\\r\\nhave explained, except that it had aroused his curiosity.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip, with the aid of the Saw-Horse, had brought a large, upholstered sofa to\\r\\nthe roof. It was an oldfashioned piece of furniture, with high back and ends,\\r\\nand it was so heavy that even by resting the greatest weight upon the back of\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse, the boy found himself out of breath when at last the clumsy sofa\\r\\nwas dumped upon the roof.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Pumpkinhead had brought a broom, which was the first thing he saw. The\\r\\nScarecrow arrived with a coil of clothes-lines and ropes which he had taken\\r\\nfrom the courtyard, and in his trip up the stairs he had become so entangled in\\r\\nthe loose ends of the ropes that both he and his burden tumbled in a heap upon\\r\\nthe roof and might have rolled off if Tip had not rescued him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman appeared last. He also had been to the courtyard, where he had\\r\\ncut four great, spreading leaves from a huge palm-tree that was the pride of\\r\\nall the inhabitants of the Emerald City.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My dear Nick!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, seeing what his friend had\\r\\ndone; “you have been guilty of the greatest crime any person can commit\\r\\nin the Emerald City. If I remember rightly, the penalty for chopping leaves\\r\\nfrom the royal palm-tree is to be killed seven times and afterward imprisoned\\r\\nfor life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It cannot be helped now” answered the Tin Woodman, throwing down\\r\\nthe big leaves upon the roof. “But it may be one more reason why it is\\r\\nnecessary for us to escape. And now let us see what you have found for me to\\r\\nwork with.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMany were the doubtful looks cast upon the heap of miscellaneous material that\\r\\nnow cluttered the roof, and finally the Scarecrow shook his head and remarked:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, if friend Nick can manufacture, from this mess of rubbish, a Thing\\r\\nthat will fly through the air and carry us to safety, then I will acknowledge\\r\\nhim to be a better mechanic than I suspected.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut the Tin Woodman seemed at first by no means sure of his powers, and only\\r\\nafter polishing his forehead vigorously with the chamois-leather did he resolve\\r\\nto undertake the task.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The first thing required for the machine,” said he, “is a\\r\\nbody big enough to carry the entire party. This sofa is the biggest thing we\\r\\nhave, and might be used for a body. But, should the machine ever tip sideways,\\r\\nwe would all slide off and fall to the ground.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not use two sofas?” asked Tip. “There’s another\\r\\none just like this down stairs.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is a very sensible suggestion,” exclaimed the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n“You must fetch the other sofa at once.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Tip and the Saw-Horse managed, with much labor, to get the second sofa to\\r\\nthe roof; and when the two were placed together, edge to edge, the backs and\\r\\nends formed a protecting rampart all around the seats.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Excellent!” cried the Scarecrow. “We can ride within this\\r\\nsnug nest quite at our ease.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe two sofas were now bound firmly together with ropes and clothes-lines, and\\r\\nthen Nick Chopper fastened the Gump’s head to one end.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will show which is the front end of the Thing,” said he,\\r\\ngreatly pleased with the idea. “And, really, if you examine it\\r\\ncritically, the Gump looks very well as a figure-head. These great palm-leaves,\\r\\nfor which I have endangered my life seven times, must serve us as wings.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are they strong enough?” asked the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are as strong as anything we can get,” answered the Woodman;\\r\\n“and although they are not in proportion to the Thing’s body, we\\r\\nare not in a position to be very particular.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo he fastened the palm-leaves to the sofas, two on each side.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSaid the Woggle-Bug, with considerable admiration:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Thing is now complete, and only needs to be brought to life.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stop a moment!” exclaimed Jack. “Are you not going to use my\\r\\nbroom?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What for?” asked the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it can be fastened to the back end for a tail,” answered the\\r\\nPumpkinhead. “Surely you would not call the Thing complete without a\\r\\ntail.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Hm!” said the Tin Woodman, “I do not see the use of a tail.\\r\\nWe are not trying to copy a beast, or a fish, or a bird. All we ask of the\\r\\nThing is to carry us through the air.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps, after the Thing is brought to life, it can use a tail to steer\\r\\nwith,” suggested the Scarecrow. “For if it flies through the air it\\r\\nwill not be unlike a bird, and I’ve noticed that all birds have tails,\\r\\nwhich they use for a rudder while flying.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” answered Nick, “the broom shall be used for a\\r\\ntail,” and he fastened it firmly to the back end of the sofa body.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nTip took the pepper-box from his pocket.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Thing looks very big,” said he, anxiously; “and I am not\\r\\nsure there is enough powder left to bring all of it to life. But I’ll\\r\\nmake it go as far as possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Put most on the wings,” said Nick Chopper; “for they must be\\r\\nmade as strong as possible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And don’t forget the head!” exclaimed the Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Or the tail!” added Jack Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do be quiet,” said Tip, nervously; “you must give me a\\r\\nchance to work the magic charm in the proper manner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nVery carefully he began sprinkling the Thing with the precious powder. Each of\\r\\nthe four wings was first lightly covered with a layer, then the sofas were\\r\\nsprinkled, and the broom given a slight coating.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The head! The head! Don’t, I beg of you, forget the head!”\\r\\ncried the Woggle-Bug, excitedly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There’s only a little of the powder left,” announced Tip,\\r\\nlooking within the box. “And it seems to me it is more important to bring\\r\\nthe legs of the sofas to life than the head.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not so,” decided the Scarecrow. “Every thing must have a\\r\\nhead to direct it; and since this creature is to fly, and not walk, it is\\r\\nreally unimportant whether its legs are alive or not.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Tip abided by this decision and sprinkled the Gump’s head with the\\r\\nremainder of the powder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now” said he, “keep silence while I work the, charm!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHaving heard old Mombi pronounce the magic words, and having also succeeded in\\r\\nbringing the Saw-Horse to life, Tip did not hesitate an instant in speaking the\\r\\nthree cabalistic words, each accompanied by the peculiar gesture of the hands.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was a grave and impressive ceremony.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he finished the incantation the Thing shuddered throughout its huge bulk,\\r\\nthe Gump gave the screeching cry that is familiar to those animals, and then\\r\\nthe four wings began flopping furiously.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTip managed to grasp a chimney, else he would have been blown off the roof by\\r\\nthe terrible breeze raised by the wings. The Scarecrow, being light in weight,\\r\\nwas caught up bodily and borne through the air until Tip luckily seized him by\\r\\none leg and held him fast. The Woggle-Bug lay flat upon the roof and so escaped\\r\\nharm, and the Tin Woodman, whose weight of tin anchored him firmly, threw both\\r\\narms around Jack Pumpkinhead and managed to save him. The Saw-Horse toppled\\r\\nover upon his back and lay with his legs waving helplessly above him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd now, while all were struggling to recover themselves, the Thing rose slowly\\r\\nfrom the roof and mounted into the air.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here! Come back!” cried Tip, in a frightened voice, as he clung to\\r\\nthe chimney with one hand and the Scarecrow with the other. “Come back at\\r\\nonce, I command you!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt was now that the wisdom of the Scarecrow, in bringing the head of the Thing\\r\\nto life instead of the legs, was proved beyond a doubt. For the Gump, already\\r\\nhigh in the air, turned its head at Tip’s command and gradually circled\\r\\naround until it could view the roof of the palace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come back!” shouted the boy, again.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd the Gump obeyed, slowly and gracefully waving its four wings in the air\\r\\nuntil the Thing had settled once more upon the roof and become still.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nIn the Jackdaw’s Nest\\n\\r\\n“This,” said the Gump, in a squeaky voice not at all proportioned\\r\\nto the size of its great body, “is the most novel experience I ever heard\\r\\nof. The last thing I remember distinctly is walking through the forest and\\r\\nhearing a loud noise. Something probably killed me then, and it certainly ought\\r\\nto have been the end of me. Yet here I am, alive again, with four monstrous\\r\\nwings and a body which I venture to say would make any respectable animal or\\r\\nfowl weep with shame to own. What does it all mean? Am I a Gump, or am I a\\r\\njuggernaut?” The creature, as it spoke, wiggled its chin whiskers in a\\r\\nvery comical manner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’re just a Thing,” answered Tip, “with a\\r\\nGump’s head on it. And we have made you and brought you to life so that\\r\\nyou may carry us through the air wherever we wish to go.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very good!” said the Thing. “As I am not a Gump, I cannot\\r\\nhave a Gump’s pride or independent spirit. So I may as well become your\\r\\nservant as anything else. My only satisfaction is that I do not seem to have a\\r\\nvery strong constitution, and am not likely to live long in a state of\\r\\nslavery.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t say that, I beg of you!” cried the Tin Woodman, whose\\r\\nexcellent heart was strongly affected by this sad speech. “Are you not\\r\\nfeeling well today?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, as for that,” returned the Gump, “it is my first day of\\r\\nexistence; so I cannot Judge whether I am feeling well or ill.” And it\\r\\nwaved its broom tail to and fro in a pensive manner.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come, come!” said the Scarecrow, kindly. “do try, to be more\\r\\ncheerful and take life as you find it. We shall be kind masters, and will\\r\\nstrive to render your existence as pleasant as possible. Are you willing to\\r\\ncarry us through the air wherever we wish to go?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Certainly,” answered the Gump. “I greatly prefer to navigate\\r\\nthe air. For should I travel on the earth and meet with one of my own species,\\r\\nmy embarrassment would be something awful!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can appreciate that,” said the Tin Woodman, sympathetically.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And yet,” continued the Thing, “when I carefully look you\\r\\nover, my masters, none of you seems to be constructed much more artistically\\r\\nthan I am.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Appearances are deceitful,” said the Woggle-Bug, earnestly.\\r\\n“I am both Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Indeed!” murmured the Gump, indifferently.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And my brains are considered remarkably rare specimens,” added the\\r\\nScarecrow, proudly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How strange!” remarked the Gump.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Although I am of tin,” said the Woodman, “I own a heart\\r\\naltogether the warmest and most admirable in the whole world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m delighted to hear it,” replied the Gump, with a slight\\r\\ncough.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“My smile,” said Jack Pumpkinhead, “is worthy your best\\r\\nattention. It is always the same.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Semper idem,” explained the Woggle-Bug, pompously; and the\\r\\nGump turned to stare at him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I,” declared the Saw-Horse, filling in an awkward pause,\\r\\n“am only remarkable because I can’t help it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am proud, indeed, to meet with such exceptional masters,” said\\r\\nthe Gump, in a careless tone. “If I could but secure so complete an\\r\\nintroduction to myself, I would be more than satisfied.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That will come in time,” remarked the Scarecrow. “To\\r\\n‘Know Thyself’ is considered quite an accomplishment, which it has\\r\\ntaken us, who are your elders, months to perfect. But now,” he added,\\r\\nturning to the others, “let us get aboard and start upon our\\r\\njourney.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where shall we go?” asked Tip, as he clambered to a seat on the\\r\\nsofas and assisted the Pumpkinhead to follow him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In the South Country rules a very delightful Queen called Glinda the\\r\\nGood, who I am sure will gladly receive us,” said the Scarecrow, getting\\r\\ninto the Thing clumsily. “Let us go to her and ask her advice.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is cleverly thought of,” declared Nick Chopper, giving the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug a boost and then toppling the Saw-Horse into the rear end of the\\r\\ncushioned seats. “I know Glinda the Good, and believe she will prove a\\r\\nfriend indeed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are we all ready?” asked the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” announced the Tin Woodman, seating himself beside the\\r\\nScarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,” said Tip, addressing the Gump, “be kind enough to fly\\r\\nwith us to the Southward; and do not go higher than to escape the houses and\\r\\ntrees, for it makes me dizzy to be up so far.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“All right,” answered the Gump, briefly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIt flopped its four huge wings and rose slowly into the air; and then, while\\r\\nour little band of adventurers clung to the backs and sides of the sofas for\\r\\nsupport, the Gump turned toward the South and soared swiftly and majestically\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“The scenic effect, from this altitude, is marvelous,” commented\\r\\nthe educated Woggle-Bug, as they rode along.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind the scenery,” said the Scarecrow. “Hold on tight,\\r\\nor you may get a tumble. The Thing seems to rock badly.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It will be dark soon,” said Tip, observing that the sun was low on\\r\\nthe horizon. “Perhaps we should have waited until morning. I wonder if\\r\\nthe Gump can fly in the night.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ve been wondering that myself,” returned the Gump quietly.\\r\\n“You see, this is a new experience to me. I used to have legs that\\r\\ncarried me swiftly over the ground. But now my legs feel as if they were\\r\\nasleep.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They are,” said Tip. “We didn’t bring ’em to\\r\\nlife.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’re expected to fly,” explained the Scarecrow. “not\\r\\nto walk.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We can walk ourselves,” said the Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I begin to understand what is required of me,” remarked the Gump;\\r\\n“so I will do my best to please you,” and he flew on for a time in\\r\\nsilence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nPresently Jack Pumpkinhead became uneasy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wonder if riding through the air is liable to spoil pumpkins,”\\r\\nhe said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not unless you carelessly drop your head over the side,” answered\\r\\nthe Woggle-Bug. “In that event your head would no longer be a pumpkin,\\r\\nfor it would become a squash.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Have I not asked you to restrain these unfeeling jokes?” demanded\\r\\nTip, looking at the Woggle-Bug with a severe expression.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have; and I’ve restrained a good many of them,” replied\\r\\nthe insect. “But there are opportunities for so many excellent puns in\\r\\nour language that, to an educated person like myself, the temptation to express\\r\\nthem is almost irresistible.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“People with more or less education discovered those puns centuries\\r\\nago,” said Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Are you sure?” asked the Woggle-Bug, with a startled look.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course I am,” answered the boy. “An educated Woggle-Bug\\r\\nmay be a new thing; but a Woggle-Bug education is as old as the hills, judging\\r\\nfrom the display you make of it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe insect seemed much impressed by this remark, and for a time maintained a\\r\\nmeek silence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow, in shifting his seat, saw upon the cushions the pepper-box which\\r\\nTip had cast aside, and began to examine it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Throw it overboard,” said the boy; “it’s quite empty\\r\\nnow, and there’s no use keeping it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Is it really empty?” asked the Scarecrow, looking curiously into\\r\\nthe box.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course it is,” answered Tip. “I shook out every grain of\\r\\nthe powder.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then the box has two bottoms,” announced the Scarecrow, “for\\r\\nthe bottom on the inside is fully an inch away from the bottom on the\\r\\noutside.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let me see,” said the Tin Woodman, taking the box from his friend.\\r\\n“Yes,” he declared, after looking it over, “the thing\\r\\ncertainly has a false bottom. Now, I wonder what that is for?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Can’t you get it apart, and find out?” enquired Tip, now\\r\\nquite interested in the mystery.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, yes; the lower bottom unscrews,” said the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n“My fingers are rather stiff; please see if you can open it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe handed the pepper-box to Tip, who had no difficulty in unscrewing the\\r\\nbottom. And in the cavity below were three silver pills, with a carefully\\r\\nfolded paper lying underneath them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis paper the boy proceeded to unfold, taking care not to spill the pills, and\\r\\nfound several lines clearly written in red ink.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Read it aloud,” said the Scarecrow. so Tip read, as follows:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“DR. NIKIDIK’S CELEBRATED WISHING PILLS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Directions for Use: Swallow one pill; count seventeen by twos;\\r\\nthen make a Wish. The Wish will immediately be granted.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCAUTION: Keep in a Dry and Dark Place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, this is a very valuable discovery!” cried the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is, indeed,” replied Tip, gravely. “These pills may be of\\r\\ngreat use to us. I wonder if old Mombi knew they were in the bottom of the\\r\\npepper-box. I remember hearing her say that she got the Powder of Life from\\r\\nthis same Nikidik.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He must be a powerful Sorcerer!” exclaimed the Tin Woodman;\\r\\n“and since the powder proved a success we ought to have confidence in the\\r\\npills.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how,” asked the Scarecrow, “can anyone count seventeen\\r\\nby twos? Seventeen is an odd number.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” replied Tip, greatly disappointed. “No one\\r\\ncan possibly count seventeen by twos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then the pills are of no use to us,” wailed the Pumpkinhead;\\r\\n“and this fact overwhelms me with grief. For I had intended wishing that\\r\\nmy head would never spoil.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense!” said the Scarecrow, sharply. “If we could use the\\r\\npills at all we would make far better wishes than that.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I do not see how anything could be better,” protested poor Jack.\\r\\n“If you were liable to spoil at any time you could understand my\\r\\nanxiety.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For my part,” said the Tin Woodman, “I sympathize with you\\r\\nin every respect. But since we cannot count seventeen by twos, sympathy is all\\r\\nyou are liable to get.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBy this time it had become quite dark, and the voyagers found above them a\\r\\ncloudy sky, through which the rays of the moon could not penetrate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Gump flew steadily on, and for some reason the huge sofa-body rocked more\\r\\nand more dizzily every hour.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug declared he was sea-sick; and Tip was also pale and somewhat\\r\\ndistressed. But the others clung to the backs of the sofas and did not seem to\\r\\nmind the motion as long as they were not tipped out.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDarker and darker grew the night, and on and on sped the Gump through the black\\r\\nheavens. The travelers could not even see one another, and an oppressive\\r\\nsilence settled down upon them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter a long time Tip, who had been thinking deeply, spoke.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How are we to know when we come to the pallace of Glinda the\\r\\nGood?” he asked.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s a long way to Glinda’s palace,” answered the\\r\\nWoodman; “I’ve traveled it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But how are we to know how fast the Gump is flying?” persisted the\\r\\nboy. “We cannot see a single thing down on the earth, and before morning\\r\\nwe may be far beyond the place we want to reach.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is all true enough,” the Scarecrow replied, a little\\r\\nuneasily. “But I do not see how we can stop just now; for we might alight\\r\\nin a river, or on, the top of a steeple; and that would be a great\\r\\ndisaster.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they permitted the Gump to fly on, with regular flops of its great wings,\\r\\nand waited patiently for morning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Tip’s fears were proven to be well founded; for with the first\\r\\nstreaks of gray dawn they looked over the sides of the sofas and discovered\\r\\nrolling plains dotted with queer villages, where the houses, instead of being\\r\\ndome-shaped—as they all are in the Land of Oz—had slanting roofs\\r\\nthat rose to a peak in the center. Odd looking animals were also moving about\\r\\nupon the open plains, and the country was unfamiliar to both the Tin Woodman\\r\\nand the Scarecrow, who had formerly visited Glinda the Good’s domain and\\r\\nknew it well.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are lost!” said the Scarecrow, dolefully. “The Gump must\\r\\nhave carried us entirely out of the Land of Oz and over the sandy deserts and\\r\\ninto the terrible outside world that Dorothy told us about.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must get back,” exclaimed the Tin Woodman, earnestly. “we\\r\\nmust get back as soon as possible!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Turn around!” cried Tip to the Gump. “turn as quickly as you\\r\\ncan!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I do I shall upset,” answered the Gump. “I’m not at\\r\\nall used to flying, and the best plan would be for me to alight in some place,\\r\\nand then I can turn around and take a fresh start.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJust then, however, there seemed to be no stopping-place that would answer\\r\\ntheir purpose. They flew over a village so big that the Woggle-Bug declared it\\r\\nwas a city, and then they came to a range of high mountains with many deep\\r\\ngorges and steep cliffs showing plainly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now is our chance to stop,” said the boy, finding they were very\\r\\nclose to the mountain tops. Then he turned to the Gump and commanded:\\r\\n“Stop at the first level place you see!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” answered the Gump, and settled down upon a table of\\r\\nrock that stood between two cliffs.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut not being experienced in such matters, the Gump did not judge his speed\\r\\ncorrectly; and instead of coming to a stop upon the flat rock he missed it by\\r\\nhalf the width of his body, breaking off both his right wings against the sharp\\r\\nedge of the rock and then tumbling over and over down the cliff.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOur friends held on to the sofas as long as they could, but when the Gump\\r\\ncaught on a projecting rock the Thing stopped suddenly—bottom side\\r\\nup—and all were immediately dumped out.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nBy good fortune they fell only a few feet; for underneath them was a monster\\r\\nnest, built by a colony of Jackdaws in a hollow ledge of rock; so none of\\r\\nthem—not even the Pumpkinhead—was injured by the fall. For Jack\\r\\nfound his precious head resting on the soft breast of the Scarecrow, which made\\r\\nan excellent cushion; and Tip fell on a mass of leaves and papers, which saved\\r\\nhim from injury. The Woggle-Bug had bumped his round head against the\\r\\nSaw-Horse, but without causing him more than a moment’s inconvenience.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman was at first much alarmed; but finding he had escaped without\\r\\neven a scratch upon his beautiful nickle-plate he at once regained his\\r\\naccustomed cheerfulness and turned to address his comrades.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Our Journey had ended rather suddenly,” said he; “and we\\r\\ncannot justly blame our friend the Gump for our accident, because he did the\\r\\nbest he could under the circumstances. But how we are ever to escape from this\\r\\nnest I must leave to someone with better brains than I possess.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHere he gazed at the Scarecrow; who crawled to the edge of the nest and looked\\r\\nover. Below them was a sheer precipice several hundred feet in depth. Above\\r\\nthem was a smooth cliff unbroken save by the point of rock where the wrecked\\r\\nbody of the Gump still hung suspended from the end of one of the sofas. There\\r\\nreally seemed to be no means of escape, and as they realized their helpless\\r\\nplight the little band of adventurers gave way to their bewilderment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This is a worse prison than the palace,” sadly remarked the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish we had stayed there,” moaned Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’m afraid the mountain air isn’t good for pumpkins.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It won’t be when the Jackdaws come back,” growled the\\r\\nSaw-Horse, which lay waving its legs in a vain endeavor to get upon its feet\\r\\nagain. “Jackdaws are especially fond of pumpkins.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do you think the birds will come here?” asked Jack, much\\r\\ndistressed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course they will,” said Tip; “for this is their nest. And\\r\\nthere must be hundreds of them,” he continued, “for see what a lot\\r\\nof things they have brought here!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nIndeed, the nest was half filled with a most curious collection of small\\r\\narticles for which the birds could have no use, but which the thieving Jackdaws\\r\\nhad stolen during many years from the homes of men. And as the nest was safely\\r\\nhidden where no human being could reach it, this lost property would never be\\r\\nrecovered.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug, searching among the rubbish—for the Jackdaws stole\\r\\nuseless things as well as valuable ones—turned up with his foot a\\r\\nbeautiful diamond necklace. This was so greatly admired by the Tin Woodman that\\r\\nthe Woggle-Bug presented it to him with a graceful speech, after which the\\r\\nWoodman hung it around his neck with much pride, rejoicing exceedingly when the\\r\\nbig diamonds glittered in the sun’s rays.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut now they heard a great jabbering and flopping of wings, and as the sound\\r\\ngrew nearer to them Tip exclaimed:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Jackdaws are coming! And if they find us here they will surely kill\\r\\nus in their anger.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I was afraid of this!” moaned the Pumpkinhead. “My time has\\r\\ncome!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And mine, also!” said the Woggle-Bug; “for Jackdaws are the\\r\\ngreatest enemies of my race.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe others were not at all afraid; but the Scarecrow at once decided to save\\r\\nthose of the party who were liable to be injured by the angry birds. So he\\r\\ncommanded Tip to take off Jack’s head and lie down with it in the bottom\\r\\nof the nest, and when this was done he ordered the Woggle-Bug to lie beside\\r\\nTip. Nick Chopper, who knew from past experience Just what to do, then took the\\r\\nScarecrow to pieces (all except his head) and scattered the straw over Tip and\\r\\nthe Woggle-Bug, completely covering their bodies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHardly had this been accomplished when the flock of Jackdaws reached them.\\r\\nPerceiving the intruders in their nest the birds flew down upon them with\\r\\nscreams of rage.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nDr. Nikidik’s Famous Wishing Pills\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman was usually a peaceful man, but when occasion required he could\\r\\nfight as fiercely as a Roman gladiator. So, when the Jackdaws nearly knocked\\r\\nhim down in their rush of wings, and their sharp beaks and claws threatened to\\r\\ndamage his brilliant plating, the Woodman picked up his axe and made it whirl\\r\\nswiftly around his head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut although many were beaten off in this way, the birds were so numerous and\\r\\nso brave that they continued the attack as furiously as before. Some of them\\r\\npecked at the eyes of the Gump, which hung over the nest in a helpless\\r\\ncondition; but the Gump’s eyes were of glass and could not be injured.\\r\\nOthers of the Jackdaws rushed at the Saw-Horse; but that animal, being still\\r\\nupon his back, kicked out so viciously with his wooden legs that he beat off as\\r\\nmany assailants as did the Woodman’s axe.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFinding themselves thus opposed, the birds fell upon the Scarecrow’s\\r\\nstraw, which lay at the center of the nest, covering Tip and the Woggle-Bug and\\r\\nJack’s pumpkin head, and began tearing it away and flying off with it,\\r\\nonly to let it drop, straw by straw into the great gulf beneath.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow’s head, noting with dismay this wanton destruction of his\\r\\ninterior, cried to the Tin Woodman to save him; and that good friend responded\\r\\nwith renewed energy. His axe fairly flashed among the Jackdaws, and fortunately\\r\\nthe Gump began wildly waving the two wings remaining on the left side of its\\r\\nbody. The flutter of these great wings filled the Jackdaws with terror, and\\r\\nwhen the Gump by its exertions freed itself from the peg of rock on which it\\r\\nhung, and sank flopping into the nest, the alarm of the birds knew no bounds\\r\\nand they fled screaming over the mountains.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhen the last foe had disappeared, Tip crawled from under the sofas and\\r\\nassisted the Woggle-Bug to follow him.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are saved!” shouted the boy, delightedly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are, indeed!” responded the Educated Insect, fairly hugging the\\r\\nstiff head of the Gump in his joy. “and we owe it all to the flopping of\\r\\nthe Thing, and the good axe of the Woodman!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If I am saved, get me out of here!” called Jack; whose head was\\r\\nstill beneath the sofas; and Tip managed to roll the pumpkin out and place it\\r\\nupon its neck again. He also set the Saw-Horse upright, and said to it:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We owe you many thanks for the gallant fight you made.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I really think we have escaped very nicely,” remarked the Tin\\r\\nWoodman, in a tone of pride.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not so!” exclaimed a hollow voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this they all turned in surprise to look at the Scarecrow’s head,\\r\\nwhich lay at the back of the nest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am completely ruined!” declared the Scarecrow, as he noted their\\r\\nastonishment. “For where is the straw that stuffs my body?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe awful question startled them all. They gazed around the nest with horror,\\r\\nfor not a vestige of straw remained. The Jackdaws had stolen it to the last\\r\\nwisp and flung it all into the chasm that yawned for hundreds of feet beneath\\r\\nthe nest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“My poor, poor friend!” said the Tin Woodman, taking up the\\r\\nScarecrow’s head and caressing it tenderly; “whoever could imagine\\r\\nyou would come to this untimely end?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I did it to save my friends,” returned the head; “and I am\\r\\nglad that I perished in so noble and unselfish a manner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why are you all so despondent?” inquired the Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n“The Scarecrow’s clothing is still safe.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” answered the Tin Woodman; “but our friend’s\\r\\nclothes are useless without stuffing.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not stuff him with money?” asked Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Money!” they all cried, in an amazed chorus.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To be sure,” said the boy. “In the bottom of the nest are\\r\\nthousands of dollar bills—and two-dollar bills—and five-dollar\\r\\nbills—and tens, and twenties, and fifties. There are enough of them to\\r\\nstuff a dozen Scarecrows. Why not use the money?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman began to turn over the rubbish with the handle of his axe; and,\\r\\nsure enough, what they had first thought only worthless papers were found to be\\r\\nall bills of various denominations, which the mischievous Jackdaws had for\\r\\nyears been engaged in stealing from the villages and cities they visited.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThere was an immense fortune lying in that inaccessible nest; and Tip’s\\r\\nsuggestion was, with the Scarecrow’s consent, quickly acted upon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey selected all the newest and cleanest bills and assorted them into various\\r\\npiles. The Scarecrow’s left leg and boot were stuffed with five-dollar\\r\\nbills; his right leg was stuffed with ten-dollar bills, and his body so closely\\r\\nfilled with fifties, one-hundreds and one-thousands that he could scarcely\\r\\nbutton his jacket with comfort.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are now” said the Woggle-Bug, impressively, when the task had\\r\\nbeen completed, “the most valuable member of our party; and as you are\\r\\namong faithful friends there is little danger of your being spent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” returned the Scarecrow, gratefully. “I feel like\\r\\na new man; and although at first glance I might be mistaken for a Safety\\r\\nDeposit Vault, I beg you to remember that my Brains are still composed of the\\r\\nsame old material. And these are the possessions that have always made me a\\r\\nperson to be depended upon in an emergency.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, the emergency is here,” observed Tip; “and unless your\\r\\nbrains help us out of it we shall be compelled to pass the remainder of our\\r\\nlives in this nest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How about these wishing pills?” enquired the Scarecrow, taking the\\r\\nbox from his jacket pocket. “Can’t we use them to escape?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not unless we can count seventeen by twos,” answered the Tin\\r\\nWoodman. “But our friend the Woggle-Bug claims to be highly educated, so\\r\\nhe ought easily to figure out how that can be done.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It isn’t a question of education,” returned the Insect;\\r\\n“it’s merely a question of mathematics. I’ve seen the\\r\\nprofessor work lots of sums on the blackboard, and he claimed anything could be\\r\\ndone with x’s and y’s and a’s, and such things, by mixing\\r\\nthem up with plenty of plusses and minuses and equals, and so forth. But he\\r\\nnever said anything, so far as I can remember, about counting up to the odd\\r\\nnumber of seventeen by the even numbers of twos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Stop! stop!” cried the Pumpkinhead. “You’re making my\\r\\nhead ache.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And mine,” added the Scarecrow. “Your mathematics seem to me\\r\\nvery like a bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what you want the\\r\\nless chance you have of getting it. I am certain that if the thing can be\\r\\naccomplished at all, it is in a very simple manner.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said Tip. “old Mombi couldn’t use x’s and\\r\\nminuses, for she never went to school.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not start counting at a half of one?” asked the Saw-Horse,\\r\\nabruptly. “Then anyone can count up to seventeen by twos very\\r\\neasily.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey looked at each other in surprise, for the Saw-Horse was considered the\\r\\nmost stupid of the entire party.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You make me quite ashamed of myself,” said the Scarecrow, bowing\\r\\nlow to the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nevertheless, the creature is right,” declared the Woggle-Bug;\\r\\n“for twice one-half is one, and if you get to one it is easy to count\\r\\nfrom one up to seventeen by twos.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wonder I didn’t think of that myself,” said the\\r\\nPumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t,” returned the Scarecrow. “You’re no\\r\\nwiser than the rest of us, are you? But let us make a wish at once. Who will\\r\\nswallow the first pill?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suppose you do it,” suggested Tip.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I can’t,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why not? You’ve a mouth, haven’t you?” asked the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes; but my mouth is painted on, and there’s no swallow connected\\r\\nwith it,” answered the Scarecrow. “In fact,” he continued,\\r\\nlooking from one to another critically, “I believe the boy and the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug are the only ones in our party that are able to swallow.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nObserving the truth of this remark, Tip said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I will undertake to make the first wish. Give me one of the Silver\\r\\nPills.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis the Scarecrow tried to do; but his padded gloves were too clumsy to clutch\\r\\nso small an object, and he held the box toward the boy while Tip selected one\\r\\nof the pills and swallowed it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Count!” cried the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“One-half, one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven,” counted Tip.\\r\\n“thirteen, fifteen, seventeen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now wish!” said the Tin Woodman anxiously:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Just then the boy began to suffer such fearful pains that he became\\r\\nalarmed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The pill has poisoned me!” he gasped; “O—h! O-o-o-o-o!\\r\\nOuch! Murder! Fire! O-o-h!” and here he rolled upon the bottom of the\\r\\nnest in such contortions that he frightened them all.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What can we do for you. Speak, I beg!” entreated the Tin Woodman,\\r\\ntears of sympathy running down his nickel cheeks.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I—I don’t know!” answered Tip. “O—h! I\\r\\nwish I’d never swallowed that pill!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen at once the pain stopped, and the boy rose to his feet again and found the\\r\\nScarecrow looking with amazement at the end of the pepper-box.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What’s happened?” asked the boy, a little ashamed of his\\r\\nrecent exhibition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, the three pills are in the box again!” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Of course they are,” the Woggle-Bug declared. “Didn’t\\r\\nTip wish that he’d never swallowed one of them? Well, the wish came true,\\r\\nand he didn’t swallow one of them. So of course they are all three\\r\\nin the box.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That may be; but the pill gave me a dreadful pain, just the same,”\\r\\nsaid the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Impossible!” declared the Woggle-Bug. “If you have never\\r\\nswallowed it, the pill can not have given you a pain. And as your wish, being\\r\\ngranted, proves you did not swallow the pill, it is also plain that you\\r\\nsuffered no pain.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then it was a splendid imitation of a pain,” retorted Tip,\\r\\nangrily. “Suppose you try the next pill yourself. We’ve wasted one\\r\\nwish already.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no, we haven’t!” protested the Scarecrow. “Here\\r\\nare still three pills in the box, and each pill is good for a wish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now you’re making my head ache,” said Tip. “I\\r\\ncan’t understand the thing at all. But I won’t take another pill, I\\r\\npromise you!” and with this remark he retired sulkily to the back of the\\r\\nnest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the Woggle-Bug, “it remains for me to save us in\\r\\nmy most Highly Magnified and Thoroughly Educated manner; for I seem to be the\\r\\nonly one able and willing to make a wish. Let me have one of the pills.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nHe swallowed it without hesitation, and they all stood admiring his courage\\r\\nwhile the Insect counted seventeen by twos in the same way that Tip had done.\\r\\nAnd for some reason—perhaps because Woggle-Bugs have stronger stomachs\\r\\nthan boys—the silver pellet caused it no pain whatever.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I wish the Gump’s broken wings mended, and as good as new!”\\r\\nsaid the Woggle-Bug, in a slow; impressive voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAll turned to look at the Thing, and so quickly had the wish been granted that\\r\\nthe Gump lay before them in perfect repair, and as well able to fly through the\\r\\nair as when it had first been brought to life on the roof of the palace.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow Appeals to Glinda the Good\\n\\r\\n“Hooray!” shouted the Scarecrow, gaily. “We can now leave\\r\\nthis miserable Jackdaws’ nest whenever we please.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it is nearly dark,” said the Tin Woodman; “and unless we\\r\\nwait until morning to make our flight we may get into more trouble. I\\r\\ndon’t like these night trips, for one never knows what will\\r\\nhappen.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo it was decided to wait until daylight, and the adventurers amused themselves\\r\\nin the twilight by searching the Jackdaws’ nest for treasures.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug found two handsome bracelets of wrought gold, which fitted his\\r\\nslender arms very well. The Scarecrow took a fancy for rings, of which there\\r\\nwere many in the nest. Before long he had fitted a ring to each finger of his\\r\\npadded gloves, and not being content with that display he added one more to\\r\\neach thumb. As he carefully chose those rings set with sparkling stones, such\\r\\nas rubies, amethysts and sapphires, the Scarecrow’s hands now presented a\\r\\nmost brilliant appearance.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“This nest would be a picnic for Queen Jinjur,” said he, musingly.\\r\\n“for as nearly as I can make out she and her girls conquered me merely to\\r\\nrob my city of its emeralds.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin Woodman was content with his diamond necklace and refused to accept any\\r\\nadditional decorations; but Tip secured a fine gold watch, which was attached\\r\\nto a heavy fob, and placed it in his pocket with much pride. He also pinned\\r\\nseveral jeweled brooches to Jack Pumpkinhead’s red waistcoat, and\\r\\nattached a lorgnette, by means of a fine chain, to the neck of the Saw-Horse.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s very pretty,” said the creature, regarding the\\r\\nlorgnette approvingly; “but what is it for?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNone of them could answer that question, however; so the Saw-Horse decided it\\r\\nwas some rare decoration and became very fond of it.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat none of the party might be slighted, they ended by placing several large\\r\\nseal rings upon the points of the Gump’s antlers, although that odd\\r\\npersonage seemed by no means gratified by the attention.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nDarkness soon fell upon them, and Tip and the Woggle-Bug went to sleep while\\r\\nthe others sat down to wait patiently for the day.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNext morning they had cause to congratulate themselves upon the useful\\r\\ncondition of the Gump; for with daylight a great flock of Jackdaws approached\\r\\nto engage in one more battle for the possession of the nest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut our adventurers did not wait for the assault. They tumbled into the\\r\\ncushioned seats of the sofas as quickly as possible, and Tip gave the word to\\r\\nthe Gump to start.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt once it rose into the air, the great wings flopping strongly and with\\r\\nregular motions, and in a few moments they were so far from the nest that the\\r\\nchattering Jackdaws took possession without any attempt at pursuit.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Thing flew due North, going in the same direction from whence it had come.\\r\\nAt least, that was the Scarecrow’s opinion, and the others agreed that\\r\\nthe Scarecrow was the best judge of direction. After passing over several\\r\\ncities and villages the Gump carried them high above a broad plain where houses\\r\\nbecame more and more scattered until they disappeared altogether. Next came the\\r\\nwide, sandy desert separating the rest of the world from the Land of Oz, and\\r\\nbefore noon they saw the dome-shaped houses that proved they were once more\\r\\nwithin the borders of their native land.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But the houses and fences are blue,” said the Tin Woodman,\\r\\n“and that indicates we are in the land of the Munchkins, and therefore a\\r\\nlong distance from Glinda the Good.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What shall we do?” asked the boy, turning to their guide.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know” replied the Scarecrow, frankly. “If we\\r\\nwere at the Emerald City we could then move directly southward, and so reach\\r\\nour destination. But we dare not go to the Emerald City, and the Gump is\\r\\nprobably carrying us further in the wrong direction with every flop of its\\r\\nwings.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then the Woggle-Bug must swallow another pill,” said Tip,\\r\\ndecidedly, “and wish us headed in the right direction.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” returned the Highly Magnified one; “I’m\\r\\nwilling.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut when the Scarecrow searched in his pocket for the pepper-box containing the\\r\\ntwo silver Wishing Pills, it was not to be found. Filled with anxiety, the\\r\\nvoyagers hunted throughout every inch of the Thing for the precious box; but it\\r\\nhad disappeared entirely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAnd still the Gump flew onward, carrying them they knew not where.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must have left the pepper-box in the Jackdaws’ nest,” said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, at length.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is a great misfortune,” the Tin Woodman declared. “But we\\r\\nare no worse off than before we discovered the Wishing Pills.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are better off,” replied Tip. “for the one pill we used\\r\\nhas enabled us to escape from that horrible nest.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yet the loss of the other two is serious, and I deserve a good scolding\\r\\nfor my carelessness,” the Scarecrow rejoined, penitently. “For in\\r\\nsuch an unusual party as this accidents are liable to happen any moment, and\\r\\neven now we may be approaching a new danger.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNo one dared contradict this, and a dismal silence ensued.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Gump flew steadily on.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSuddenly Tip uttered an exclamation of surprise. “We must have reached\\r\\nthe South Country,” he cried, “for below us everything is\\r\\nred!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nImmediately they all leaned over the backs of the sofas to look—all\\r\\nexcept Jack, who was too careful of his pumpkin head to risk its slipping off\\r\\nhis neck. Sure enough; the red houses and fences and trees indicated they were\\r\\nwithin the domain of Glinda the Good; and presently, as they glided rapidly on,\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman recognized the roads and buildings they passed, and altered\\r\\nslightly the flight of the Gump so that they might reach the palace of the\\r\\ncelebrated Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good!” cried the Scarecrow, delightedly. “We do not need the\\r\\nlost Wishing Pills now, for we have arrived at our destination.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGradually the Thing sank lower and nearer to the ground until at length it came\\r\\nto rest within the beautiful gardens of Glinda, settling upon a velvety green\\r\\nlawn close by a fountain which sent sprays of flashing gems, instead of water,\\r\\nhigh into the air, whence they fell with a soft, tinkling sound into the carved\\r\\nmarble basin placed to receive them.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nEverything was very gorgeous in Glinda’s gardens, and while our voyagers\\r\\ngazed about with admiring eyes a company of soldiers silently appeared and\\r\\nsurrounded them. But these soldiers of the great Sorceress were entirely\\r\\ndifferent from those of Jinjur’s Army of Revolt, although they were\\r\\nlikewise girls. For Glinda’s soldiers wore neat uniforms and bore swords\\r\\nand spears; and they marched with a skill and precision that proved them well\\r\\ntrained in the arts of war.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Captain commanding this troop—which was Glinda’s private Body\\r\\nGuard—recognized the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman at once, and greeted\\r\\nthem with respectful salutations.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Good day!” said the Scarecrow, gallantly removing his hat, while\\r\\nthe Woodman gave a soldierly salute; “we have come to request an audience\\r\\nwith your fair Ruler.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Glinda is now within her palace, awaiting you,” returned the\\r\\nCaptain; “for she saw you coming long before you arrived.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is strange!” said Tip, wondering.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not at all,” answered the Scarecrow, “for Glinda the Good is\\r\\na mighty Sorceress, and nothing that goes on in the Land of Oz escapes her\\r\\nnotice. I suppose she knows why we came as well as we do ourselves.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then what was the use of our coming?” asked Jack, stupidly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To prove you are a Pumpkinhead!” retorted the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“But, if the Sorceress expects us, we must not keep her waiting.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they all clambered out of the sofas and followed the Captain toward the\\r\\npalace—even the Saw-Horse taking his place in the queer procession.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nUpon her throne of finely wrought gold sat Glinda, and she could scarcely\\r\\nrepress a smile as her peculiar visitors entered and bowed before her. Both the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman she knew and liked; but the awkward Pumpkinhead\\r\\nand Highly Magnified Woggle-Bug were creatures she had never seen before, and\\r\\nthey seemed even more curious than the others. As for the Saw-Horse, he looked\\r\\nto be nothing more than an animated chunk of wood; and he bowed so stiffly that\\r\\nhis head bumped against the floor, causing a ripple of laughter among the\\r\\nsoldiers, in which Glinda frankly joined.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg to announce to your glorious highness,” began the Scarecrow,\\r\\nin a solemn voice, “that my Emerald City has been overrun by a crowd of\\r\\nimpudent girls with knitting-needles, who have enslaved all the men, robbed the\\r\\nstreets and public buildings of all their emerald jewels, and usurped my\\r\\nthrone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” said Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They also threatened to destroy me, as well as all the good friends and\\r\\nallies you see before you,” continued the Scarecrow. “and had we\\r\\nnot managed to escape their clutches our days would long since have\\r\\nended.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I know it,” repeated Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Therefore I have come to beg your assistance,” resumed the\\r\\nScarecrow, “for I believe you are always glad to succor the unfortunate\\r\\nand oppressed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” replied the Sorceress, slowly. “But the\\r\\nEmerald City is now ruled by General Jinjur, who has caused herself to be\\r\\nproclaimed Queen. What right have I to oppose her?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, she stole the throne from me,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And how came you to possess the throne?” asked Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I got it from the Wizard of Oz, and by the choice of the people,”\\r\\nreturned the Scarecrow, uneasy at such questioning.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And where did the Wizard get it?” she continued gravely.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am told he took it from Pastoria, the former King,” said the\\r\\nScarecrow, becoming confused under the intent look of the Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,” declared Glinda, “the throne of the Emerald City\\r\\nbelongs neither to you nor to Jinjur, but to this Pastoria from whom the Wizard\\r\\nusurped it.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is true,” acknowledged the Scarecrow, humbly; “but\\r\\nPastoria is now dead and gone, and some one must rule in his place.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Pastoria had a daughter, who is the rightful heir to the throne of the\\r\\nEmerald City. Did you know that?” questioned the Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” replied the Scarecrow. “But if the girl still lives I\\r\\nwill not stand in her way. It will satisfy me as well to have Jinjur turned\\r\\nout, as an impostor, as to regain the throne myself. In fact, it isn’t\\r\\nmuch fun to be King, especially if one has good brains. I have known for some\\r\\ntime that I am fitted to occupy a far more exalted position. But where is the\\r\\ngirl who owns the throne, and what is her name?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Her name is Ozma,” answered Glinda. “But where she is I have\\r\\ntried in vain to discover. For the Wizard of Oz, when he stole the throne from\\r\\nOzma’s father, hid the girl in some secret place; and by means of a\\r\\nmagical trick with which I am not familiar he also managed to prevent her being\\r\\ndiscovered—even by so experienced a Sorceress as myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is strange,” interrupted the Woggle-Bug, pompously. “I\\r\\nhave been informed that the Wonderful Wizard of Oz was nothing more than a\\r\\nhumbug!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Nonsense!” exclaimed the Scarecrow, much provoked by this speech.\\r\\n“Didn’t he give me a wonderful set of brains?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“There’s no humbug about my heart,” announced the Tin\\r\\nWoodman, glaring indignantly at the Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps I was misinformed,” stammered the Insect, shrinking back;\\r\\n“I never knew the Wizard personally.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well, we did,” retorted the Scarecrow, “and he was a very\\r\\ngreat Wizard, I assure you. It is true he was guilty of some slight impostures,\\r\\nbut unless he was a great Wizard how—let me ask—could he have\\r\\nhidden this girl Ozma so securely that no one can find her?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I—I give it up!” replied the Woggle-Bug, meekly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is the most sensible speech you’ve made,” said the Tin\\r\\nWoodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I must really make another effort to discover where this girl is\\r\\nhidden,” resumed the Sorceress, thoughtfully. “I have in my library\\r\\na book in which is inscribed every action of the Wizard while he was in our\\r\\nland of Oz—or, at least, every action that could be observed by my spies.\\r\\nThis book I will read carefully tonight, and try to single out the acts that\\r\\nmay guide us in discovering the lost Ozma. In the meantime, pray amuse\\r\\nyourselves in my palace and command my servants as if they were your own. I\\r\\nwill grant you another audience tomorrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nWith this gracious speech Glinda dismissed the adventurers, and they wandered\\r\\naway through the beautiful gardens, where they passed several hours enjoying\\r\\nall the delightful things with which the Queen of the Southland had surrounded\\r\\nher royal palace.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOn the following morning they again appeared before Glinda, who said to them:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I have searched carefully through the records of the Wizard’s\\r\\nactions, and among them I can find but three that appear to have been\\r\\nsuspicious. He ate beans with a knife, made three secret visits to old Mombi,\\r\\nand limped slightly on his left foot.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! that last is certainly suspicious!” exclaimed the Pumpkinhead.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not necessarily,” said the Scarecrow. “he may, have had\\r\\ncorns. Now, it seems to me his eating beans with a knife is more\\r\\nsuspicious.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps it is a polite custom in Omaha, from which great country the\\r\\nWizard originally came,” suggested the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It may be,” admitted the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But why,” asked Glinda, “did he make three secret visits to\\r\\nold Mombi?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! Why, indeed!” echoed the Woggle-Bug, impressively.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We know that the Wizard taught the old woman many of his tricks of\\r\\nmagic,” continued Glinda; “and this he would not have done had she\\r\\nnot assisted him in some way. So we may suspect with good reason that Mombi\\r\\naided him to hide the girl Ozma, who was the real heir to the throne of the\\r\\nEmerald City, and a constant danger to the usurper. For, if the people knew\\r\\nthat she lived, they would quickly make her their Queen and restore her to her\\r\\nrightful position.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“An able argument!” cried the Scarecrow. “I have no doubt\\r\\nthat Mombi was mixed up in this wicked business. But how does that knowledge\\r\\nhelp us?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must find Mombi,” replied Glinda, “and force her to tell\\r\\nwhere the girl is hidden.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Mombi is now with Queen Jinjur, in the Emerald, City” said Tip.\\r\\n“It was she who threw so many obstacles in our pathway, and made Jinjur\\r\\nthreaten to destroy my friends and give me back into the old witch’s\\r\\npower.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,” decided Glinda, “I will march with my army to the\\r\\nEmerald City, and take Mombi prisoner. After that we can, perhaps, force her to\\r\\ntell the truth about Ozma.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“She is a terrible old woman!” remarked Tip, with a shudder at the\\r\\nthought of Mombi’s black kettle; “and obstinate, too.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am quite obstinate myself,” returned the Sorceress, with a sweet\\r\\nsmile. “so I do not fear Mombi in the least. Today I will make all\\r\\nnecessary preparations, and we will march upon the Emerald City at daybreak\\r\\ntomorrow.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Tin-Woodman Plucks a Rose\\n\\r\\nThe Army of Glinda the Good looked very grand and imposing when it assembled at\\r\\ndaybreak before the palace gates. The uniforms of the girl soldiers were pretty\\r\\nand of gay colors, and their silver-tipped spears were bright and glistening,\\r\\nthe long shafts being inlaid with mother-of-pearl. All the officers wore sharp,\\r\\ngleaming swords, and shields edged with peacock-feathers; and it really seemed\\r\\nthat no foe could by any possibility defeat such a brilliant army.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Sorceress rode in a beautiful palanquin which was like the body of a coach,\\r\\nhaving doors and windows with silken curtains; but instead of wheels, which a\\r\\ncoach has, the palanquin rested upon two long, horizontal bars, which were\\r\\nborne upon the shoulders of twelve servants.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and his comrades decided to ride in the Gump, in order to keep up\\r\\nwith the swift march of the army; so, as soon as Glinda had started and her\\r\\nsoldiers had marched away to the inspiring strains of music played by the royal\\r\\nband, our friends climbed into the sofas and followed. The Gump flew along\\r\\nslowly at a point directly over the palanquin in which rode the Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Be careful,” said the Tin Woodman to the Scarecrow, who was\\r\\nleaning far over the side to look at the army below. “You might\\r\\nfall.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It wouldn’t matter,” remarked the educated Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n“he can’t get broke so long as he is stuffed with money.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Didn’t I ask you” began Tip, in a reproachful voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You did!” said the Woggle-Bug, promptly. “And I beg your\\r\\npardon. I will really try to restrain myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You’d better,” declared the boy. “That is, if you wish\\r\\nto travel in our company.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Ah! I couldn’t bear to part with you now,” murmured the\\r\\nInsect, feelingly; so Tip let the subject drop.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe army moved steadily on, but night had fallen before they came to the walls\\r\\nof the Emerald City. By the dim light of the new moon, however, Glinda’s\\r\\nforces silently surrounded the city and pitched their tents of scarlet silk\\r\\nupon the greensward. The tent of the Sorceress was larger than the others, and\\r\\nwas composed of pure white silk, with scarlet banners flying above it. A tent\\r\\nwas also pitched for the Scarecrow’s party; and when these preparations\\r\\nhad been made, with military precision and quickness, the army retired to rest.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGreat was the amazement of Queen Jinjur next morning when her soldiers came\\r\\nrunning to inform her of the vast army surrounding them. She at once climbed to\\r\\na high tower of the royal palace and saw banners waving in every direction and\\r\\nthe great white tent of Glinda standing directly before the gates.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We are surely lost!” cried Jinjur, in despair; “for how can\\r\\nour knitting-needles avail against the long spears and terrible swords of our\\r\\nfoes?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The best thing we can do,” said one of the girls, “is to\\r\\nsurrender as quickly as possible, before we get hurt.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not so,” returned Jinjur, more bravely. “The enemy is still\\r\\noutside the walls, so we must try to gain time by engaging them in parley. Go\\r\\nyou with a flag of truce to Glinda and ask her why she has dared to invade my\\r\\ndominions, and what are her demands.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo the girl passed through the gates, bearing a white flag to show she was on a\\r\\nmission of peace, and came to Glinda’s tent. “Tell your\\r\\nQueen,” said the Sorceress to the girl, “that she must deliver up\\r\\nto me old Mombi, to be my prisoner. If this is done I will not molest her\\r\\nfarther.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nNow when this message was delivered to the Queen it filled her with dismay, for\\r\\nMombi was her chief counsellor, and Jinjur was terribly afraid of the old hag.\\r\\nBut she sent for Mombi, and told her what Glinda had said.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I see trouble ahead for all of us,” muttered the old witch, after\\r\\nglancing into a magic mirror she carried in her pocket. “But we may even\\r\\nyet escape by deceiving this sorceress, clever as she thinks herself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Don’t you think it will be safer for me to deliver you into her\\r\\nhands?” asked Jinjur, nervously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“If you do, it will cost you the throne of the Emerald City!”\\r\\nanswered the witch, positively. “But if you will let me have my own way,\\r\\nI can save us both very easily.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then do as you please,” replied Jinjur, “for it is so\\r\\naristocratic to be a Queen that I do not wish to be obliged to return home\\r\\nagain, to make beds and wash dishes for my mother.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Mombi called Jellia Jamb to her, and performed a certain magical rite with\\r\\nwhich she was familiar. As a result of the enchantment Jellia took on the form\\r\\nand features of Mombi, while the old witch grew to resemble the girl so closely\\r\\nthat it seemed impossible anyone could guess the deception.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said old Mombi to the Queen, “let your soldiers\\r\\ndeliver up this girl to Glinda. She will think she has the real Mombi in her\\r\\npower, and so will return immediately to her own country in the South.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nTherefore Jellia, hobbling along like an aged woman, was led from the city\\r\\ngates and taken before Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is the person you demanded,” said one of the guards,\\r\\n“and our Queen now begs you will go away, as you promised, and leave us\\r\\nin peace.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That I will surely do,” replied Glinda, much pleased; “if\\r\\nthis is really the person she seems to be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It is certainly old Mombi,” said the guard, who believed she was\\r\\nspeaking the truth; and then Jinjur’s soldiers returned within the\\r\\ncity’s gates.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Sorceress quickly summoned the Scarecrow and his friends to her tent, and\\r\\nbegan to question the supposed Mombi about the lost girl Ozma. But Jellia knew\\r\\nnothing at all of this affair, and presently she grew so nervous under the\\r\\nquestioning that she gave way and began to weep, to Glinda’s great\\r\\nastonishment.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Here is some foolish trickery!” said the Sorceress, her eyes\\r\\nflashing with anger. “This is not Mombi at all, but some other person who\\r\\nhas been made to resemble her! Tell me,” she demanded, turning to the\\r\\ntrembling girl, “what is your name?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis Jellia dared not tell, having been threatened with death by the witch if\\r\\nshe confessed the fraud. But Glinda, sweet and fair though she was, understood\\r\\nmagic better than any other person in the Land of Oz. So, by uttering a few\\r\\npotent words and making a peculiar gesture, she quickly transformed the girl\\r\\ninto her proper shape, while at the same time old Mombi, far away in\\r\\nJinjur’s palace, suddenly resumed her own crooked form and evil features.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why, it’s Jellia Jamb!” cried the Scarecrow, recognizing in\\r\\nthe girl one of his old friends.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It’s our interpreter!” said the Pumpkinhead, smiling\\r\\npleasantly.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThen Jellia was forced to tell of the trick Mombi had played and she also\\r\\nbegged Glinda’s protection, which the Sorceress readily granted. But\\r\\nGlinda was now really angry, and sent word to Jinjur that the fraud was\\r\\ndiscovered and she must deliver up the real Mombi or suffer terrible\\r\\nconsequences. Jinjur was prepared for this message, for the witch well\\r\\nunderstood, when her natural form was thrust upon her, that Glinda had\\r\\ndiscovered her trickery. But the wicked old creature had already thought up a\\r\\nnew deception, and had made Jinjur promise to carry it out. So the Queen said\\r\\nto Glinda’s messenger:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Tell your mistress that I cannot find Mombi anywhere, but that Glinda is\\r\\nwelcome to enter the city and search herself for the old woman. She may also\\r\\nbring her friends with her, if she likes; but if she does not find Mombi by\\r\\nsundown, the Sorceress must promise to go away peaceably and bother us no\\r\\nmore.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda agreed to these terms, well knowing that Mombi was somewhere within the\\r\\ncity walls. So Jinjur caused the gates to be thrown open, and Glinda marched in\\r\\nat the head of a company of soldiers, followed by the Scarecrow and the Tin\\r\\nWoodman, while Jack Pumpkinhead rode astride the Saw-Horse, and the Educated,\\r\\nHighly Magnified Woggle-Bug sauntered behind in a dignified manner. Tip walked\\r\\nby the side of the Sorceress, for Glinda had conceived a great liking for the\\r\\nboy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOf course old Mombi had no intention of being found by Glinda; so, while her\\r\\nenemies were marching up the street, the witch transformed herself into a red\\r\\nrose growing upon a bush in the garden of the palace. It was a clever idea, and\\r\\na trick Glinda did not suspect; so several precious hours were spent in a vain\\r\\nsearch for Mombi.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAs sundown approached the Sorceress realized she had been defeated by the\\r\\nsuperior cunning of the aged witch; so she gave the command to her people to\\r\\nmarch out of the city and back to their tents.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Scarecrow and his comrades happened to be searching in the garden of the\\r\\npalace just then, and they turned with disappointment to obey Glinda’s\\r\\ncommand. But before they left the garden the Tin Woodman, who was fond of\\r\\nflowers, chanced to espy a big red rose growing upon a bush; so he plucked the\\r\\nflower and fastened it securely in the tin buttonhole of his tin bosom.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs he did this he fancied he heard a low moan proceed from the rose; but he\\r\\npaid no attention to the sound, and Mombi was thus carried out of the city and\\r\\ninto Glinda’s camp without anyone having a suspicion that they had\\r\\nsucceeded in their quest.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Transformation of Old Mombi\\n\\r\\nThe Witch was at first frightened at finding herself captured by the enemy; but\\r\\nsoon she decided that she was exactly as safe in the Tin Woodman’s\\r\\nbutton-hole as growing upon the bush. For no one knew the rose and Mombi to be\\r\\none, and now that she was without the gates of the City her chances of escaping\\r\\naltogether from Glinda were much improved.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But there is no hurry,” thought Mombi. “I will wait awhile\\r\\nand enjoy the humiliation of this Sorceress when she finds I have outwitted\\r\\nher.” So throughout the night the rose lay quietly on the Woodman’s\\r\\nbosom, and in the morning, when Glinda summoned our friends to a consultation,\\r\\nNick Chopper carried his pretty flower with him to the white silk tent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“For some reason,” said Glinda, “we have failed to find this\\r\\ncunning old Mombi; so I fear our expedition will prove a failure. And for that\\r\\nI am sorry, because without our assistance little Ozma will never be rescued\\r\\nand restored to her rightful position as Queen of the Emerald City”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do not let us give up so easily,” said the Pumpkinhead. “Let\\r\\nus do something else.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Something else must really be done,” replied Glinda, with a smile.\\r\\n“yet I cannot understand how I have been defeated so easily by an old\\r\\nWitch who knows far less of magic than I do myself.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“While we are on the ground I believe it would be wise for us to conquer\\r\\nthe Emerald City for Princess Ozma, and find the girl afterward,” said\\r\\nthe Scarecrow. “And while the girl remains hidden I will gladly rule in\\r\\nher place, for I understand the business of ruling much better than Jinjur\\r\\ndoes.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But I have promised not to molest Jinjur,” objected Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suppose you all return with me to my kingdom—or Empire,\\r\\nrather,” said the Tin Woodman, politely including the entire party in a\\r\\nroyal wave of his arm. “It will give me great pleasure to entertain you\\r\\nin my castle, where there is room enough and to spare. And if any of you wish\\r\\nto be nickel-plated, my valet will do it free of all expense.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile the Woodman was speaking Glinda’s eyes had been noting the rose in\\r\\nhis button-hole, and now she imagined she saw the big red leaves of the flower\\r\\ntremble slightly. This quickly aroused her suspicions, and in a moment more the\\r\\nSorceress had decided that the seeming rose was nothing else than a\\r\\ntransformation of old Mombi. At the same instant Mombi knew she was discovered\\r\\nand must quickly plan an escape, and as transformations were easy to her she\\r\\nimmediately took the form of a Shadow and glided along the wall of the tent\\r\\ntoward the entrance, thinking thus to disappear.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut Glinda had not only equal cunning, but far more experience than the Witch.\\r\\nSo the Sorceress reached the opening of the tent before the Shadow, and with a\\r\\nwave of her hand closed the entrance so securely that Mombi could not find a\\r\\ncrack big enough to creep through. The Scarecrow and his friends were greatly\\r\\nsurprised at Glinda’s actions; for none of them had noted the Shadow. But\\r\\nthe Sorceress said to them:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Remain perfectly quiet, all of you! For the old Witch is even now with\\r\\nus in this tent, and I hope to capture her.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThese words so alarmed Mombi that she quickly transformed herself from a shadow\\r\\nto a Black Ant, in which shape she crawled along the ground, seeking a crack or\\r\\ncrevice in which to hide her tiny body.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFortunately, the ground where the tent had been pitched, being Just before the\\r\\ncity gates, was hard and smooth; and while the Ant still crawled about, Glinda\\r\\ndiscovered it and ran quickly forward to effect its capture But, Just as her\\r\\nhand was descending, the Witch, now fairly frantic with fear, made her last\\r\\ntransformation, and in the form of a huge Griffin sprang through the wall of\\r\\nthe tent—tearing the silk asunder in her rush—and in a moment had\\r\\ndarted away with the speed of a whirlwind.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda did not hesitate to follow. She sprang upon the back of the Saw-Horse\\r\\nand cried:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now you shall prove that you have a right to be alive!\\r\\nRun—run—run!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse ran. Like a flash he followed the Griffin, his wooden legs moving\\r\\nso fast that they twinkled like the rays of a star. Before our friends could\\r\\nrecover from their surprise both the Griffin and the Saw-Horse had dashed out\\r\\nof sight.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Come! Let us follow!” cried the Scarecrow.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThey ran to the place where the Gump was lying and quickly tumbled aboard.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Fly!” commanded Tip, eagerly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Where to?” asked the Gump, in its calm voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I don’t know,” returned Tip, who was very nervous at the\\r\\ndelay; “but if you will mount into the air I think we can discover which\\r\\nway Glinda has gone.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well,” returned the Gump, quietly; and it spread its great\\r\\nwings and mounted high into the air.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nFar away, across the meadows, they could now see two tiny specks, speeding one\\r\\nafter the other; and they knew these specks must be the Griffin and the\\r\\nSaw-Horse. So Tip called the Gump’s attention to them and bade the\\r\\ncreature try to overtake the Witch and the Sorceress. But, swift as was the\\r\\nGump’s flight, the pursued and pursuer moved more swiftly yet, and within\\r\\na few moments were blotted out against the dim horizon.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Let us continue to follow them, nevertheless,” said the Scarecrow.\\r\\n“for the Land of Oz is of small extent, and sooner or later they must\\r\\nboth come to a halt.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOld Mombi had thought herself very wise to choose the form of a Griffin, for\\r\\nits legs were exceedingly fleet and its strength more enduring than that of\\r\\nother animals. But she had not reckoned on the untiring energy of the\\r\\nSaw-Horse, whose wooden limbs could run for days without slacking their speed.\\r\\nTherefore, after an hour’s hard running, the Griffin’s breath began\\r\\nto fail, and it panted and gasped painfully, and moved more slowly than before.\\r\\nThen it reached the edge of the desert and began racing across the deep sands.\\r\\nBut its tired feet sank far into the sand, and in a few minutes the Griffin\\r\\nfell forward, completely exhausted, and lay still upon the desert waste.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda came up a moment later, riding the still vigorous Saw-Horse; and having\\r\\nunwound a slender golden thread from her girdle the Sorceress threw it over the\\r\\nhead of the panting and helpless Griffin, and so destroyed the magical power of\\r\\nMombi’s transformation.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nFor the animal, with one fierce shudder, disappeared from view, while in its\\r\\nplace was discovered the form of the old Witch, glaring savagely at the serene\\r\\nand beautiful face of the Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nPrincess Ozma of Oz\\n\\r\\n“You are my prisoner, and it is useless for you to struggle any\\r\\nlonger,” said Glinda, in her soft, sweet voice. “Lie still a\\r\\nmoment, and rest yourself, and then I will carry you back to my tent.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why do you seek me?” asked Mombi, still scarce able to speak\\r\\nplainly for lack of breath. “What have I done to you, to be so\\r\\npersecuted?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You have done nothing to me,” answered the gentle Sorceress;\\r\\n“but I suspect you have been guilty of several wicked actions; and if I\\r\\nfind it is true that you have so abused your knowledge of magic, I intend to\\r\\npunish you severely.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I defy you!” croaked the old hag. “You dare not harm\\r\\nme!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJust then the Gump flew up to them and alighted upon the desert sands beside\\r\\nGlinda. Our friends were delighted to find that Mombi had finally been\\r\\ncaptured, and after a hurried consultation it was decided they should all\\r\\nreturn to the camp in the Gump. So the Saw-Horse was tossed aboard, and then\\r\\nGlinda still holding an end of the golden thread that was around Mombi’s\\r\\nneck, forced her prisoner to climb into the sofas. The others now followed, and\\r\\nTip gave the word to the Gump to return.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Journey was made in safety, Mombi sitting in her place with a grim and\\r\\nsullen air; for the old hag was absolutely helpless so long as the magical\\r\\nthread encircled her throat. The army hailed Glinda’s return with loud\\r\\ncheers, and the party of friends soon gathered again in the royal tent, which\\r\\nhad been neatly repaired during their absence.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said the Sorceress to Mombi, “I want you to tell us\\r\\nwhy the Wonderful Wizard of Oz paid you three visits, and what became of the\\r\\nchild, Ozma, which so curiously disappeared.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Witch looked at Glinda defiantly, but said not a word.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Answer me!” cried the Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut still Mombi remained silent.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Perhaps she doesn’t know,” remarked Jack.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I beg you will keep quiet,” said Tip. “You might spoil\\r\\neverything with your foolishness.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Very well, dear father!” returned the Pumpkinhead, meekly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“How glad I am to be a Woggle-Bug!” murmured the Highly Magnified\\r\\nInsect, softly. “No one can expect wisdom to flow from a pumpkin.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” said the Scarecrow, “what shall we do to make Mombi\\r\\nspeak? Unless she tells us what we wish to know her capture will do us no good\\r\\nat all.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suppose we try kindness,” suggested the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n“I’ve heard that anyone can be conquered with kindness, no matter\\r\\nhow ugly they may be.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this the Witch turned to glare upon him so horribly that the Tin Woodman\\r\\nshrank back abashed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda had been carefully considering what to do, and now she turned to Mombi\\r\\nand said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You will gain nothing, I assure you, by thus defying us. For I am\\r\\ndetermined to learn the truth about the girl Ozma, and unless you tell me all\\r\\nthat you know, I will certainly put you to death.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, no! Don’t do that!” exclaimed the Tin Woodman. “It\\r\\nwould be an awful thing to kill anyone—even old Mombi!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But it is merely a threat,” returned Glinda. “I shall not\\r\\nput Mombi to death, because she will prefer to tell me the truth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, I see!” said the tin man, much relieved.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Suppose I tell you all that you wish to know,”. said Mombi,\\r\\nspeaking so suddenly that she startled them all. “What will you do with\\r\\nme then?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In that case,” replied Glinda, “I shall merely ask you to\\r\\ndrink a powerful draught which will cause you to forget all the magic you have\\r\\never learned.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then I would become a helpless old woman!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But you would be alive,” suggested the Pumpkinhead, consolingly.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Do try to keep silent!” said Tip, nervously.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I’ll try,” responded Jack; “but you will admit that\\r\\nit’s a good thing to be alive.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Especially if one happens to be Thoroughly Educated,” added the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug, nodding approval.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You may make your choice,” Glinda said to old Mombi,\\r\\n“between death if you remain silent, and the loss of your magical powers\\r\\nif you tell me the truth. But I think you will prefer to live.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi cast an uneasy glance at the Sorceress, and saw that she was in earnest,\\r\\nand not to be trifled with. So she replied, slowly:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I will answer your questions.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is what I expected,” said Glinda, pleasantly. “You have\\r\\nchosen wisely, I assure you.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nShe then motioned to one of her Captains, who brought her a beautiful golden\\r\\ncasket. From this the Sorceress drew an immense white pearl, attached to a\\r\\nslender chain which she placed around her neck in such a way that the pearl\\r\\nrested upon her bosom, directly over her heart.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Now,” said she, “I will ask my first question: Why did the\\r\\nWizard pay you three visits?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Because I would not come to him,” answered Mombi.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is no answer,” said Glinda, sternly. “Tell me the\\r\\ntruth.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Well,” returned Mombi, with downcast eyes, “he visited me to\\r\\nlearn the way I make tea-biscuits.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Look up!” commanded the Sorceress.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi obeyed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What is the color of my pearl?” demanded Glinda.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Why—it is black!” replied the old Witch, in a tone of\\r\\nwonder.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then you have told me a falsehood!” cried Glinda, angrily.\\r\\n“Only when the truth is spoken will my magic pearl remain a pure white in\\r\\ncolor.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMombi now saw how useless it was to try to deceive the Sorceress; so she said,\\r\\nmeanwhile scowling at her defeat:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Wizard brought to me the girl Ozma, who was then no more than a\\r\\nbaby, and begged me to conceal the child.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“That is what I thought,” declared Glinda, calmly. “What did\\r\\nhe give you for thus serving him?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“He taught me all the magical tricks he knew. Some were good tricks, and\\r\\nsome were only frauds; but I have remained faithful to my promise.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“What did you do with the girl?” asked Glinda; and at this question\\r\\neveryone bent forward and listened eagerly for the reply.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I enchanted her,” answered Mombi.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“In what way?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I transformed her into—into—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Into what?” demanded Glinda, as the Witch hesitated.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Into a boy!” said Mombi, in a low tone.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“A boy!” echoed every voice; and then, because they knew that this\\r\\nold woman had reared Tip from childhood, all eyes were turned to where the boy\\r\\nstood.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Yes,” said the old Witch, nodding her head; “that is the\\r\\nPrincess Ozma—the child brought to me by the Wizard who stole her\\r\\nfather’s throne. That is the rightful ruler of the Emerald City!”\\r\\nand she pointed her long bony finger straight at the boy.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I!” cried Tip, in amazement. “Why, I’m no Princess\\r\\nOzma—I’m not a girl!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda smiled, and going to Tip she took his small brown hand within her dainty\\r\\nwhite one.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are not a girl just now” said she, gently, “because\\r\\nMombi transformed you into a boy. But you were born a girl, and also a\\r\\nPrincess; so you must resume your proper form, that you may become Queen of the\\r\\nEmerald City.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Oh, let Jinjur be the Queen!” exclaimed Tip, ready to cry.\\r\\n“I want to stay a boy, and travel with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman,\\r\\nand the Woggle-Bug, and Jack—yes! and my friend the Saw-Horse—and\\r\\nthe Gump! I don’t want to be a girl!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Never mind, old chap,” said the Tin Woodman, soothingly; “it\\r\\ndon’t hurt to be a girl, I’m told; and we will all remain your\\r\\nfaithful friends just the same. And, to be honest with you, I’ve always\\r\\nconsidered girls nicer than boys.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“They’re just as nice, anyway,” added the Scarecrow, patting\\r\\nTip affectionately upon the head.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“And they are equally good students,” proclaimed the Woggle-Bug.\\r\\n“I should like to become your tutor, when you are transformed into a girl\\r\\nagain.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“But—see here!” said Jack Pumpkinhead, with a gasp: “if\\r\\nyou become a girl, you can’t be my dear father any more!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“No,” answered Tip, laughing in spite of his anxiety. “and I\\r\\nshall not be sorry to escape the relationship.” Then he added,\\r\\nhesitatingly, as he turned to Glinda: “I might try it for awhile,-just to\\r\\nsee how it seems, you know. But if I don’t like being a girl you must\\r\\npromise to change me into a boy again.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Really,” said the Sorceress, “that is beyond my magic. I\\r\\nnever deal in transformations, for they are not honest, and no respectable\\r\\nsorceress likes to make things appear to be what they are not. Only\\r\\nunscrupulous witches use the art, and therefore I must ask Mombi to effect your\\r\\nrelease from her charm, and restore you to your proper form. It will be the\\r\\nlast opportunity she will have to practice magic.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nNow that the truth about Princes Ozma had been discovered, Mombi did not care\\r\\nwhat became of Tip; but she feared Glinda’s anger, and the boy generously\\r\\npromised to provide for Mombi in her old age if he became the ruler of the\\r\\nEmerald City. So the Witch consented to effect the transformation, and\\r\\npreparations for the event were at once made.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda ordered her own royal couch to be placed in the center of the tent. It\\r\\nwas piled high with cushions covered with rose-colored silk, and from a golden\\r\\nrailing above hung many folds of pink gossamer, completely concealing the\\r\\ninterior of the couch.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe first act of the Witch was to make the boy drink a potion which quickly\\r\\nsent him into a deep and dreamless sleep. Then the Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug bore him gently to the couch, placed him upon the soft cushions, and\\r\\ndrew the gossamer hangings to shut him from all earthly view.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Witch squatted upon the ground and kindled a tiny fire of dried herbs,\\r\\nwhich she drew from her bosom. When the blaze shot up and burned clearly old\\r\\nMombi scattered a handful of magical powder over the fire, which straightway\\r\\ngave off a rich violet vapor, filling all the tent with its fragrance and\\r\\nforcing the Saw-Horse to sneeze—although he had been warned to keep\\r\\nquiet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThen, while the others watched her curiously, the hag chanted a rhythmical\\r\\nverse in words which no one understood, and bent her lean body seven times back\\r\\nand forth over the fire. And now the incantation seemed complete, for the Witch\\r\\nstood upright and cried the one word “Yeowa!” in a loud voice.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe vapor floated away; the atmosphere became, clear again; a whiff of fresh\\r\\nair filled the tent, and the pink curtains of the couch trembled slightly, as\\r\\nif stirred from within.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nGlinda walked to the canopy and parted the silken hangings. Then she bent over\\r\\nthe cushions, reached out her hand, and from the couch arose the form of a\\r\\nyoung girl, fresh and beautiful as a May morning. Her eyes sparkled as two\\r\\ndiamonds, and her lips were tinted like a tourmaline. All adown her back\\r\\nfloated tresses of ruddy gold, with a slender jeweled circlet confining them at\\r\\nthe brow. Her robes of silken gauze floated around her like a cloud, and dainty\\r\\nsatin slippers shod her feet.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAt this exquisite vision Tip’s old comrades stared in wonder for the\\r\\nspace of a full minute, and then every head bent low in honest admiration of\\r\\nthe lovely Princess Ozma. The girl herself cast one look into Glinda’s\\r\\nbright face, which glowed with pleasure and satisfaction, and then turned upon\\r\\nthe others. Speaking the words with sweet diffidence, she said:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I hope none of you will care less for me than you did before. I’m\\r\\njust the same Tip, you know; only—only—”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Only you’re different!” said the Pumpkinhead; and everyone\\r\\nthought it was the wisest speech he had ever made.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Riches of Content\\n\\r\\nWhen the wonderful tidings reached the ears of Queen Jinjur—how Mombi the\\r\\nWitch had been captured; how she had confessed her crime to Glinda; and how the\\r\\nlong-lost Princess Ozma had been discovered in no less a personage than the boy\\r\\nTip—she wept real tears of grief and despair.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“To think,” she moaned, “that after having ruled as Queen,\\r\\nand lived in a palace, I must go back to scrubbing floors and churning butter\\r\\nagain! It is too horrible to think of! I will never consent!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo when her soldiers, who spent most of their time making fudge in the palace\\r\\nkitchens, counseled Jinjur to resist, she listened to their foolish prattle and\\r\\nsent a sharp defiance to Glinda the Good and the Princess Ozma. The result was\\r\\na declaration of war, and the very next day Glinda marched upon the Emerald\\r\\nCity with pennants flying and bands playing, and a forest of shining spears,\\r\\nsparkling brightly beneath the sun’s rays.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nBut when it came to the walls this brave assembly made a sudden halt; for\\r\\nJinjur had closed and barred every gateway, and the walls of the Emerald City\\r\\nwere builded high and thick with many blocks of green marble. Finding her\\r\\nadvance thus baffled, Glinda bent her brows in deep thought, while the\\r\\nWoggle-Bug said, in his most positive tone:\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“We must lay siege to the city, and starve it into submission. It is the\\r\\nonly thing we can do.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Not so,” answered the Scarecrow. “We still have the Gump,\\r\\nand the Gump can still fly”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Sorceress turned quickly at this speech, and her face now wore a bright\\r\\nsmile.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are right,” she exclaimed, “and certainly have reason to\\r\\nbe proud of your brains. Let us go to the Gump at once!”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo they passed through the ranks of the army until they came to the place, near\\r\\nthe Scarecrow’s tent, where the Gump lay. Glinda and Princess Ozma\\r\\nmounted first, and sat upon the sofas. Then the Scarecrow and his friends\\r\\nclimbed aboard, and still there was room for a Captain and three soldiers,\\r\\nwhich Glinda considered sufficient for a guard.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nNow, at a word from the Princess, the queer Thing they had called the Gump\\r\\nflopped its palm-leaf wings and rose into the air, carrying the party of\\r\\nadventurers high above the walls. They hovered over the palace, and soon\\r\\nperceived Jinjur reclining in a hammock in the courtyard, where she was\\r\\ncomfortably reading a novel with a green cover and eating green chocolates,\\r\\nconfident that the walls would protect her from her enemies. Obeying a quick\\r\\ncommand, the Gump alighted safely in this very courtyard, and before Jinjur had\\r\\ntime to do more than scream, the Captain and three soldiers leaped out and made\\r\\nthe former Queen a prisoner, locking strong chains upon both her wrists.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThat act really ended the war; for the Army of Revolt submitted as soon as they\\r\\nknew Jinjur to be a captive, and the Captain marched in safety through the\\r\\nstreets and up to the gates of the city, which she threw wide open. Then the\\r\\nbands played their most stirring music while Glinda’s army marched into\\r\\nthe city, and heralds proclaimed the conquest of the audacious Jinjur and the\\r\\naccession of the beautiful Princess Ozma to the throne of her royal ancestors.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAt once the men of the Emerald City cast off their aprons. And it is said that\\r\\nthe women were so tired eating of their husbands’ cooking that they all\\r\\nhailed the conquest of Jinjur with Joy. Certain it is that, rushing one and all\\r\\nto the kitchens of their houses, the good wives prepared so delicious a feast\\r\\nfor the weary men that harmony was immediately restored in every family.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOzma’s first act was to oblige the Army of Revolt to return to her every\\r\\nemerald or other gem stolen from the public streets and buildings; and so great\\r\\nwas the number of precious stones picked from their settings by these vain\\r\\ngirls, that every one of the royal jewelers worked steadily for more than a\\r\\nmonth to replace them in their settings.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile the Army of Revolt was disbanded and the girls sent home to their\\r\\nmothers. On promise of good behavior Jinjur was likewise released.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nOzma made the loveliest Queen the Emerald City had ever known; and, although\\r\\nshe was so young and inexperienced, she ruled her people with wisdom and\\r\\nJustice. For Glinda gave her good advice on all occasions; and the Woggle-Bug,\\r\\nwho was appointed to the important post of Public Educator, was quite helpful\\r\\nto Ozma when her royal duties grew perplexing.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe girl, in her gratitude to the Gump for its services, offered the creature\\r\\nany reward it might name.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Then,” replied the Gump, “please take me to pieces. I did\\r\\nnot wish to be brought to life, and I am greatly ashamed of my conglomerate\\r\\npersonality. Once I was a monarch of the forest, as my antlers fully prove; but\\r\\nnow, in my present upholstered condition of servitude, I am compelled to fly\\r\\nthrough the air—my legs being of no use to me whatever. Therefore I beg\\r\\nto be dispersed.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nSo Ozma ordered the Gump taken apart. The antlered head was again hung over the\\r\\nmantle-piece in the hall, and the sofas were untied and placed in the reception\\r\\nparlors. The broom tail resumed its accustomed duties in the kitchen, and\\r\\nfinally, the Scarecrow replaced all the clotheslines and ropes on the pegs from\\r\\nwhich he had taken them on the eventful day when the Thing was constructed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nYou might think that was the end of the Gump; and so it was, as a\\r\\nflying-machine. But the head over the mantle-piece continued to talk whenever\\r\\nit took a notion to do so, and it frequently startled, with its abrupt\\r\\nquestions, the people who waited in the hall for an audience with the Queen.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Saw-Horse, being Ozma’s personal property, was tenderly cared for;\\r\\nand often she rode the queer creature along the streets of the Emerald City.\\r\\nShe had its wooden legs shod with gold, to keep them from wearing out, and the\\r\\ntinkle of these golden shoes upon the pavement always filled the Queen’s\\r\\nsubjects with awe as they thought upon this evidence of her magical powers.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“The Wonderful Wizard was never so wonderful as Queen Ozma,” the\\r\\npeople said to one another, in whispers; “for he claimed to do many\\r\\nthings he could not do; whereas our new Queen does many things no one would\\r\\never expect her to accomplish.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nJack Pumpkinhead remained with Ozma to the end of his days; and he did not\\r\\nspoil as soon as he had feared, although he always remained as stupid as ever.\\r\\nThe Woggle-Bug tried to teach him several arts and sciences; but Jack was so\\r\\npoor a student that any attempt to educate him was soon abandoned.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nAfter Glinda’s army had marched back home, and peace was restored to the\\r\\nEmerald City, the Tin Woodman announced his intention to return to his own\\r\\nKingdom of the Winkies.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“It isn’t a very big Kingdom,” said he to Ozma, “but\\r\\nfor that very reason it is easier to rule; and I have called myself an Emperor\\r\\nbecause I am an Absolute Monarch, and no one interferes in any way with my\\r\\nconduct of public or personal affairs. When I get home I shall have a new coat\\r\\nof nickel plate; for I have become somewhat marred and scratched lately; and\\r\\nthen I shall be glad to have you pay me a visit.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“Thank you,” replied Ozma. “Some day I may accept the\\r\\ninvitation. But what is to become of the Scarecrow?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I shall return with my friend the Tin Woodman,” said the stuffed\\r\\none, seriously. “We have decided never to be parted in the future.”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n“And I have made the Scarecrow my Royal Treasurer,” explained the\\r\\nTin Woodman. “For it has occurred to me that it is a good thing to have a\\r\\nRoyal Treasurer who is made of money. What do you think?”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I think,” said the little Queen, smiling, “that your friend\\r\\nmust be the richest man in all the world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“I am,” returned the Scarecrow. “but not on account of my\\r\\nmoney. For I consider brains far superior to money, in every way. You may have\\r\\nnoticed that if one has money without brains, he cannot use it to advantage;\\r\\nbut if one has brains without money, they will enable him to live comfortably\\r\\nto the end of his days.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“At the same time,” declared the Tin Woodman, “you must\\r\\nacknowledge that a good heart is a thing that brains can not create, and that\\r\\nmoney can not buy. Perhaps, after all, it is I who am the richest man in all\\r\\nthe world.”\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n“You are both rich, my friends,” said Ozma, gently; “and your\\r\\nriches are the only riches worth having—the riches of content!”\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n The End\\n\\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MARVELLOUS LAND OF OZ ***\\n\\n\\r\\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will\\r\\nbe renamed.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\\r\\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\\r\\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\\r\\nStates without permission and without paying copyright\\r\\nroyalties.

Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\\r\\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\\r\\nvisit www.gutenberg.org/donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.

For forty years, he produced and\\r\\ndistributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of\\r\\nvolunteer support.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed\\r\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\\r\\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\\r\\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper\\r\\nedition.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nMost people start at our website which has the main PG search\\r\\nfacility: www.gutenberg.org.\\r\\n\\n\\r\\nThis website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,\\r\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\r\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\r\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Their sweet\\r\\nlittle letters plead to know \"more about Dorothy\"; and they ask: \"What\\r\\nbecame of the Cowardly Lion?\" and \"What did Ozma do\\r\\nafterward?\"—meaning, of course, after she became the Ruler of Oz. And\\r\\nsome of them suggest plots to me, saying: \"Please have Dorothy go to the\\r\\nLand of Oz again\"; or, \"Why don\\'t you make Ozma and Dorothy meet, and\\r\\nhave a good time together?\" Indeed, could I do all that my little\\r\\nfriends ask, I would be obliged to write dozens of books to satisfy\\r\\ntheir demands. And I wish I could, for I enjoy writing these stories\\r\\njust as much as the children say they enjoy reading them.\\nWell, here is \"more about Dorothy,\" and about our old friends the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and about the Cowardly Lion, and Ozma,\\r\\nand all the rest of them; and here, likewise, is a good deal about some\\r\\nnew folks that are queer and unusual. One little friend, who read this\\r\\nstory before it was printed, said to me: \"Billina is real Ozzy, Mr.\\r\\nBaum, and so are Tiktok and the Hungry Tiger.\"\\nIf this judgment is unbiased and correct, and the little folks find this\\r\\nnew story \"real Ozzy,\" I shall be very glad indeed that I wrote it. But\\r\\nperhaps I shall get some more of those very welcome letters from my\\r\\nreaders, telling me just how they like \"Ozma of Oz.\" I hope so, anyway.\\n\\r\\nL. FRANK BAUM.\\n\\nMACATAWA, 1907.\\n[Pg 12]\\n\\n\\n[Pg 13]\\n\\nThe Girl in the Chicken Coop\\n\\n \\n \\nThe wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean, sending ripples\\r\\nacross its surface. Then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until\\r\\nthey became waves, and shoved the waves around until they became\\r\\nbillows. The billows rolled dreadfully high: higher even than the tops\\r\\nof houses. Some of them, indeed, rolled as high as the tops of tall\\r\\ntrees, and seemed like mountains, and the gulfs between the great\\r\\nbillows were like deep valleys.\\nAll this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean, which\\r\\nthe mischievous[Pg 14] wind caused without any good reason whatever, resulted\\r\\nin a terrible storm, and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many\\r\\nqueer pranks and do a lot of damage.\\nAt the time the wind began to blow, a ship was sailing far out upon the\\r\\nwaters. When the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and\\r\\nbigger the ship rolled up and down, and tipped sidewise—first one way\\r\\nand then the other—and was jostled around so roughly that even the\\r\\nsailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves\\r\\nfrom being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea.\\nAnd the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn\\'t get\\r\\nthrough them; so that the day grew dark as night, which added to the\\r\\nterrors of the storm.\\nThe Captain of the ship was not afraid, because he had seen storms\\r\\nbefore, and had sailed his ship through them in safety; but he knew that\\r\\nhis passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck, so he\\r\\nput them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the\\r\\nstorm was over, and to keep brave hearts and not be scared, and all\\r\\nwould be well with them.\\n\\nNow, among these passengers was a little Kansas[Pg 15] girl named Dorothy\\r\\nGale, who was going with her Uncle Henry to Australia, to visit some\\r\\nrelatives they had never before seen. Uncle Henry, you must know, was\\r\\nnot very well, because he had been working so hard on his Kansas farm\\r\\nthat his health had given way and left him weak and nervous. So he left\\r\\nAunt Em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the\\r\\nfarm, while he traveled far away to Australia to visit his cousins and\\r\\nhave a good rest.\\nDorothy was eager to go with him on this journey, and Uncle Henry\\r\\nthought she would be good company and help cheer him up; so he decided\\r\\nto take her along. The little girl was quite an experienced traveller,\\r\\nfor she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the\\r\\nmarvelous Land of Oz, and she had met with a good many adventures in\\r\\nthat strange country before she managed to get back to Kansas again. So\\r\\nshe wasn\\'t easily frightened, whatever happened, and when the wind began\\r\\nto howl and whistle, and the waves began to tumble and toss, our little\\r\\ngirl didn\\'t mind the uproar the least bit.\\n\"Of course we\\'ll have to stay in the cabin,\" she said to Uncle Henry and\\r\\nthe other passengers, \"and keep as quiet as possible until the storm is\\r\\nover.[Pg 16] For the Captain says if we go on deck we may be blown overboard.\"\\nNo one wanted to risk such an accident as that, you may be sure; so all\\r\\nthe passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin, listening to the\\r\\nshrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and\\r\\ntrying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped\\r\\nsidewise.\\nDorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to\\r\\nfind that Uncle Henry was missing. She couldn\\'t imagine where he had\\r\\ngone, and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him, and to\\r\\nfear he might have been careless enough to go on deck. In that case he\\r\\nwould be in great danger unless he instantly came down again.\\nThe fact was that Uncle Henry had gone to lie down in his little\\r\\nsleeping-berth, but Dorothy did not know that. She only remembered that\\r\\nAunt Em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle, so at once she\\r\\ndecided to go on deck and find him, in spite of the fact that the\\r\\ntempest was now worse than ever, and the ship was plunging in a really\\r\\ndreadful manner. Indeed, the little girl found it was as much as she\\r\\ncould do to mount the stairs to the deck, and as soon as she got there\\r\\nthe wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the[Pg 18][Pg 17] skirts of\\r\\nher dress. Yet Dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the\\r\\nstorm, and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through\\r\\nthe gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast\\r\\nnot far away from her. This might be her uncle, so she called as loudly\\r\\nas she could:\\n\"Uncle Henry! Uncle Henry!\"\\n\\n\\n\"UNCLE HENRY! UNCLE HENRY!\" CALLED DOROTHY\\n\\nBut the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own\\r\\nvoice, and the man certainly failed to hear her, for he did not move.\\nDorothy decided she must go to him; so she made a dash forward, during a\\r\\nlull in the storm, to where a big square chicken-coop had been lashed to\\r\\nthe deck with ropes. She reached this place in safety, but no sooner had\\r\\nshe seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens\\r\\nwere kept than the wind, as if enraged because the little girl dared to\\r\\nresist its power, suddenly redoubled its fury. With a scream like that\\r\\nof an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted\\r\\nit high into the air, with Dorothy still clinging to the slats. Around\\r\\nand over it whirled, this way and that, and a few moments later the\\r\\nchicken-coop dropped far away into the sea, where the big waves caught\\r\\nit and slid it up-hill to a foaming crest and then down[Pg 19]hill into a deep\\r\\nvalley, as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused.\\nDorothy had a good ducking, you may be sure, but she didn\\'t loose her\\r\\npresence of mind even for a second. She kept tight hold of the stout\\r\\nslats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw\\r\\nthat the wind had ripped the cover from the coop, and the poor chickens\\r\\nwere fluttering away in every direction, being blown by the wind until\\r\\nthey looked like feather dusters without handles. The bottom of the coop\\r\\nwas made of thick boards, so Dorothy found she was clinging to a sort of\\r\\nraft, with sides of slats, which readily bore up her weight. After\\r\\ncoughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath again, she\\r\\nmanaged to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of\\r\\nthe coop, which supported her easily enough.\\n\"Why, I\\'ve got a ship of my own!\" she thought, more amused than\\r\\nfrightened at her sudden change of condition; and then, as the coop\\r\\nclimbed up to the top of a big wave, she looked eagerly around for the\\r\\nship from which she had been blown.\\nIt was far, far away, by this time. Perhaps no one on board had yet\\r\\nmissed her, or knew of her strange adventure. Down into a valley\\r\\nbetween[Pg 20] the waves the coop swept her, and when she climbed another\\r\\ncrest the ship looked like a toy boat, it was such a long way off. Soon\\r\\nit had entirely disappeared in the gloom, and then Dorothy gave a sigh\\r\\nof regret at parting with Uncle Henry and began to wonder what was going\\r\\nto happen to her next.\\nJust now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean, with nothing to\\r\\nkeep her afloat but a miserable wooden hen-coop that had a plank bottom\\r\\nand slatted sides, through which the water constantly splashed and\\r\\nwetted her through to the skin! And there was nothing to eat when she\\r\\nbecame hungry—as she was sure to do before long—and no fresh water to\\r\\ndrink and no dry clothes to put on.\\n\"Well, I declare!\" she exclaimed, with a laugh. \"You\\'re in a pretty fix,\\r\\nDorothy Gale, I can tell you! and I haven\\'t the least idea how you\\'re\\r\\ngoing to get out of it!\"\\nAs if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on, and the gray\\r\\nclouds overhead changed to inky blackness. But the wind, as if satisfied\\r\\nat last with its mischievous pranks, stopped blowing this ocean and\\r\\nhurried away to another part of the world to blow something else; so\\r\\nthat the waves, not being joggled any more, began to quiet down and\\r\\nbehave themselves.[Pg 21]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY AFLOAT IN THE HEN-COOP\\n[Pg 22]\\nIt was lucky for Dorothy, I think, that the storm subsided; otherwise,\\r\\nbrave though she was, I fear she might have perished. Many children, in\\r\\nher place, would have wept and given way to despair; but because Dorothy\\r\\nhad encountered so many adventures and come safely through them it did\\r\\nnot occur to her at this time to be especially afraid. She was wet and\\r\\nuncomfortable, it is true; but, after sighing that one sigh I told you\\r\\nof, she managed to recall some of her customary cheerfulness and decided\\r\\nto patiently await whatever her fate might be.\\nBy and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky overhead,\\r\\nwith a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it and little stars\\r\\nwinking merrily at Dorothy when she looked their way. The coop did not\\r\\ntoss around any more, but rode the waves more gently—almost like a\\r\\ncradle rocking—so that the floor upon which Dorothy stood was no longer\\r\\nswept by water coming through the slats. Seeing this, and being quite\\r\\nexhausted by the excitement of the past few hours, the little girl\\r\\ndecided that sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength and\\r\\nthe easiest way in which she could pass the time. The floor was damp and\\r\\nshe was herself wringing wet, but fortunately this was a warm climate\\r\\nand she did not feel at all cold.[Pg 23] So she sat down in a corner of the\\r\\ncoop, leaned her back against the slats, nodded at the friendly stars\\r\\nbefore she closed her eyes, and was asleep in half a minute.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 24]\\n\\nThe Yellow Hen\\n\\n \\n \\nA strange noise awoke Dorothy, who opened her eyes to find that day had\\r\\ndawned and the sun was shining brightly in a clear sky. She had been\\r\\ndreaming that she was back in Kansas again, and playing in the old\\r\\nbarn-yard with the calves and pigs and chickens all around her; and at\\r\\nfirst, as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, she really imagined she\\r\\nwas there.\\n\"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut! Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-kut!\"\\nAh; here again was the strange noise that had awakened her. Surely it\\r\\nwas a hen cackling![Pg 25] But her wide-open eyes first saw, through the slats\\r\\nof the coop, the blue waves of the ocean, now calm and placid, and her\\r\\nthoughts flew back to the past night, so full of danger and discomfort.\\r\\nAlso she began to remember that she was a waif of the storm, adrift upon\\r\\na treacherous and unknown sea.\\n\"Kut-kut-kut, ka-daw-w-w—kut!\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\" cried Dorothy, starting to her feet.\\n\"Why, I\\'ve just laid an egg, that\\'s all,\" replied a small, but sharp and\\r\\ndistinct voice, and looking around her the little girl discovered a\\r\\nyellow hen squatting in the opposite corner of the coop.\\n\"Dear me!\" she exclaimed, in surprise; \"have you been here all night,\\r\\ntoo?\"\\n\"Of course,\" answered the hen, fluttering her wings and yawning. \"When\\r\\nthe coop blew away from the ship I clung fast to this corner, with claws\\r\\nand beak, for I knew if I fell into the water I\\'d surely be drowned.\\r\\nIndeed, I nearly drowned, as it was, with all that water washing over\\r\\nme. I never was so wet before in my life!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" agreed Dorothy, \"it was pretty wet, for a time, I know. But do\\r\\nyou feel comfor\\'ble now?\"\\n\"Not very. The sun has helped to dry my feathers, as it has your dress,\\r\\nand I feel better since I laid my morning egg. But what\\'s to become of[Pg 26]\\r\\nus, I should like to know, afloat on this big pond?\"\\n\"I\\'d like to know that, too,\" said Dorothy. \"But, tell me; how does it\\r\\nhappen that you are able to talk? I thought hens could only cluck and\\r\\ncackle.\"\\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered the yellow hen thoughtfully, \"I\\'ve clucked\\r\\nand cackled all my life, and never spoken a word before this morning,\\r\\nthat I can remember. But when you asked a question, a minute ago, it\\r\\nseemed the most natural thing in the world to answer you. So I spoke,\\r\\nand I seem to keep on speaking, just as you and other human beings do.\\r\\nStrange, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Very,\" replied Dorothy. \"If we were in the Land of Oz, I wouldn\\'t think\\r\\nit so queer, because many of the animals can talk in that fairy country.\\r\\nBut out here in the ocean must be a good long way from Oz.\"\\n\"How is my grammar?\" asked the yellow hen, anxiously. \"Do I speak quite\\r\\nproperly, in your judgment?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Dorothy, \"you do very well, for a beginner.\"\\n\"I\\'m glad to know that,\" continued the yellow hen, in a confidential\\r\\ntone; \"because, if one is going to talk, it\\'s best to talk correctly.\\r\\nThe red rooster has often said that my cluck and my cackle were[Pg 27] quite\\r\\nperfect; and now it\\'s a comfort to know I am talking properly.\"\\n\"I\\'m beginning to get hungry,\" remarked Dorothy. \"It\\'s breakfast time;\\r\\nbut there\\'s no breakfast.\"\\n\"You may have my egg,\" said the yellow hen. \"I don\\'t care for it, you\\r\\nknow.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you want to hatch it?\" asked the little girl, in surprise.\\n\"No, indeed; I never care to hatch eggs unless I\\'ve a nice snug nest, in\\r\\nsome quiet place, with a baker\\'s dozen of eggs under me. That\\'s\\r\\nthirteen, you know, and it\\'s a lucky number for hens. So you may as well\\r\\neat this egg.\"\\n\"Oh, I couldn\\'t poss\\'bly eat it, unless it was cooked,\" exclaimed\\r\\nDorothy. \"But I\\'m much obliged for your kindness, just the same.\"\\n\"Don\\'t mention it, my dear,\" answered the hen, calmly, and began pruning\\r\\nher feathers.\\nFor a moment Dorothy stood looking out over the wide sea. She was still\\r\\nthinking of the egg, though; so presently she asked:\\n\"Why do you lay eggs, when you don\\'t expect to hatch them?\"\\n\"It\\'s a habit I have,\" replied the yellow hen. \"It has always been my\\r\\npride to lay a fresh egg every[Pg 28] morning, except when I\\'m moulting. I\\r\\nnever feel like having my morning cackle till the egg is properly laid,\\r\\nand without the chance to cackle I would not be happy.\"\\n\"It\\'s strange,\" said the girl, reflectively; \"But as I\\'m not a hen I\\r\\ncan\\'t be \\'spected to understand that.\"\\n\"Certainly not, my dear.\"\\nThen Dorothy fell silent again. The yellow hen was some company, and a\\r\\nbit of comfort, too; but it was dreadfully lonely out on the big ocean,\\r\\nnevertheless.\\nAfter a time the hen flew up and perched upon the topmost slat of the\\r\\ncoop, which was a little above Dorothy\\'s head when she was sitting upon\\r\\nthe bottom, as she had been doing for some moments past.\\n\"Why, we are not far from land!\" exclaimed the hen.\\n\"Where? Where is it?\" cried Dorothy, jumping up in great excitement.\\n\"Over there a little way,\" answered the hen, nodding her head in a\\r\\ncertain direction. \"We seem to be drifting toward it, so that before\\r\\nnoon we ought to find ourselves upon dry land again.\"\\n\"I shall like that!\" said Dorothy, with a little sigh, for her feet and\\r\\nlegs were still wetted now and[Pg 30][Pg 29] then by the sea-water that came through\\r\\nthe open slats.\\n\\n\\nTHE YELLOW HEN\\n\\n\"So shall I,\" answered her companion. \"There is nothing in the world so\\r\\nmiserable as a wet hen.\"\\nThe land, which they seemed to be rapidly approaching, since it grew\\r\\nmore distinct every minute, was quite beautiful as viewed by the little\\r\\ngirl in the floating hen-coop. Next to the water was a broad beach of\\r\\nwhite sand and gravel, and farther back were several rocky hills, while\\r\\nbeyond these appeared a strip of green trees that marked the edge of a\\r\\nforest. But there were no houses to be seen, nor any sign of people who\\r\\nmight inhabit this unknown land.\\n\"I hope we shall find something to eat,\" said Dorothy, looking eagerly\\r\\nat the pretty beach toward which they drifted. \"It\\'s long past breakfast\\r\\ntime, now.\"\\n\"I\\'m a trifle hungry, myself,\" declared the yellow hen.\\n\"Why don\\'t you eat the egg?\" asked the child. \"You don\\'t need to have\\r\\nyour food cooked, as I do.\"\\n\"Do you take me for a cannibal?\" cried the hen, indignantly. \"I do not\\r\\nknow what I have said or done that leads you to insult me!\"\\n\"I beg your pardon, I\\'m sure Mrs.—Mrs.—by the[Pg 31] way, may I inquire your\\r\\nname, ma\\'am?\" asked the little girl.\\n\"My name is Bill,\" said the yellow hen, somewhat gruffly.\\n\"Bill! Why, that\\'s a boy\\'s name.\"\\n\"What difference does that make?\"\\n\"You\\'re a lady hen, aren\\'t you?\"\\n\"Of course. But when I was first hatched out no one could tell whether I\\r\\nwas going to be a hen or a rooster; so the little boy at the farm where\\r\\nI was born called me Bill, and made a pet of me because I was the only\\r\\nyellow chicken in the whole brood. When I grew up, and he found that I\\r\\ndidn\\'t crow and fight, as all the roosters do, he did not think to\\r\\nchange my name, and every creature in the barn-yard, as well as the\\r\\npeople in the house, knew me as \\'Bill.\\' So Bill I\\'ve always been called,\\r\\nand Bill is my name.\"\\n\"But it\\'s all wrong, you know,\" declared Dorothy, earnestly; \"and, if\\r\\nyou don\\'t mind, I shall call you \\'Billina.\\' Putting the \\'eena\\' on the\\r\\nend makes it a girl\\'s name, you see.\"\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind it in the least,\" returned the yellow hen. \"It doesn\\'t\\r\\nmatter at all what you call me, so long as I know the name means me.\"\\n\"Very well, Billina. My name is Dorothy Gale[Pg 32]—just Dorothy to my\\r\\nfriends and Miss Gale to strangers. You may call me Dorothy, if you\\r\\nlike. We\\'re getting very near the shore. Do you suppose it is too deep\\r\\nfor me to wade the rest of the way?\"\\n\"Wait a few minutes longer. The sunshine is warm and pleasant, and we\\r\\nare in no hurry.\"\\n\"But my feet are all wet and soggy,\" said the girl. \"My dress is dry\\r\\nenough, but I won\\'t feel real comfor\\'ble till I get my feet dried.\"\\nShe waited; however, as the hen advised, and before long the big wooden\\r\\ncoop grated gently on the sandy beach and the dangerous voyage was over.\\nIt did not take the castaways long to reach the shore, you may be sure.\\r\\nThe yellow hen flew to the sands at once, but Dorothy had to climb over\\r\\nthe high slats. Still, for a country girl, that was not much of a feat,\\r\\nand as soon as she was safe ashore Dorothy drew off her wet shoes and\\r\\nstockings and spread them upon the sun-warmed beach to dry.\\nThen she sat down and watched Billina, who was pick-pecking away with\\r\\nher sharp bill in the sand and gravel, which she scratched up and turned\\r\\nover with her strong claws.\\n\"What are you doing?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Getting my breakfast, of course,\" murmured the hen, busily pecking\\r\\naway.[Pg 33]\\n\\n\\n\"HOW DREADFUL!\" EXCLAIMED DOROTHY\\n[Pg 34]\\n\"What do you find?\" inquired the girl, curiously.\\n\"Oh, some fat red ants, and some sand-bugs, and once in a while a tiny\\r\\ncrab. They are very sweet and nice, I assure you.\"\\n\"How dreadful!\" exclaimed Dorothy, in a shocked voice.\\n\"What is dreadful?\" asked the hen, lifting her head to gaze with one\\r\\nbright eye at her companion.\\n\"Why, eating live things, and horrid bugs, and crawly ants. You ought to\\r\\nbe \\'shamed of yourself!\"\\n\"Goodness me!\" returned the hen, in a puzzled tone; \"how queer you are,\\r\\nDorothy! Live things are much fresher and more wholesome than dead ones,\\r\\nand you humans eat all sorts of dead creatures.\"\\n\"We don\\'t!\" said Dorothy.\\n\"You do, indeed,\" answered Billina. \"You eat lambs and sheep and cows\\r\\nand pigs and even chickens.\"\\n\"But we cook \\'em,\" said Dorothy, triumphantly.\\n\"What difference does that make?\"\\n\"A good deal,\" said the girl, in a graver tone. \"I can\\'t just \\'splain\\r\\nthe diff\\'rence, but it\\'s there. And, anyhow, we never eat such dreadful\\r\\nthings as bugs.\"\\n\"But you eat the chickens that eat the bugs,\" retorted the yellow hen,\\r\\nwith an odd cackle. \"So you are just as bad as we chickens are.\"[Pg 35]\\nThis made Dorothy thoughtful. What Billina said was true enough, and it\\r\\nalmost took away her appetite for breakfast. As for the yellow hen, she\\r\\ncontinued to peck away at the sand busily, and seemed quite contented\\r\\nwith her bill-of-fare.\\nFinally, down near the water\\'s edge, Billina stuck her bill deep into\\r\\nthe sand, and then drew back and shivered.\\n\"Ow!\" she cried. \"I struck metal, that time, and it nearly broke my\\r\\nbeak.\"\\n\"It prob\\'bly was a rock,\" said Dorothy, carelessly.\\n\"Nonsense. I know a rock from metal, I guess,\" said the hen. \"There\\'s a\\r\\ndifferent feel to it.\"\\n\"But there couldn\\'t be any metal on this wild, deserted seashore,\"\\r\\npersisted the girl. \"Where\\'s the place? I\\'ll dig it up, and prove to you\\r\\nI\\'m right.\"\\nBillina showed her the place where she had \"stubbed her bill,\" as she\\r\\nexpressed it, and Dorothy dug away the sand until she felt something\\r\\nhard. Then, thrusting in her hand, she pulled the thing out, and\\r\\ndiscovered it to be a large sized golden key—rather old, but still\\r\\nbright and of perfect shape.\\n\"What did I tell you?\" cried the hen, with a cackle of triumph. \"Can I\\r\\ntell metal when I bump into it, or is the thing a rock?\"\\n\"It\\'s metal, sure enough,\" answered the child, gaz[Pg 36]ing thoughtfully at\\r\\nthe curious thing she had found. \"I think it is pure gold, and it must\\r\\nhave lain hidden in the sand for a long time. How do you suppose it came\\r\\nthere, Billina? And what do you suppose this mysterious key unlocks?\"\\n\"I can\\'t say,\" replied the hen. \"You ought to know more about locks and\\r\\nkeys than I do.\"\\nDorothy glanced around. There was no sign of any house in that part of\\r\\nthe country, and she reasoned that every key must fit a lock and every\\r\\nlock must have a purpose. Perhaps the key had been lost by somebody who\\r\\nlived far away, but had wandered on this very shore.\\nMusing on these things the girl put the key in the pocket of her dress\\r\\nand then slowly drew on her shoes and stockings, which the sun had fully\\r\\ndried.\\n\"I b\\'lieve, Billina,\" she said, \"I\\'ll have a look \\'round, and see if I\\r\\ncan find some breakfast.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 37]\\n\\nLetters in the Sand\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nWalking a little way back from the water\\'s edge, toward the grove of\\r\\ntrees, Dorothy came to a flat stretch of white sand that seemed to have\\r\\nqueer signs marked upon its surface, just as one would write upon sand\\r\\nwith a stick.\\n\"What does it say?\" she asked the yellow hen, who trotted along beside\\r\\nher in a rather dignified fashion.\\n\"How should I know?\" returned the hen. \"I cannot read.\"\\n\"Oh! Can\\'t you?\"\\n\"Certainly not; I\\'ve never been to school, you know.\"[Pg 38]\\n\"Well, I have,\" admitted Dorothy; \"but the letters are big and far\\r\\napart, and it\\'s hard to spell out the words.\"\\nBut she looked at each letter carefully, and finally discovered that\\r\\nthese words were written in the sand:\\n\\n\"BEWARE THE WHEELERS!\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s rather strange,\" declared the hen, when Dorothy had read aloud\\r\\nthe words. \"What do you suppose the Wheelers are?\"\\n\"Folks that wheel, I guess. They must have wheelbarrows, or baby-cabs or\\r\\nhand-carts,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Perhaps they\\'re automobiles,\" suggested the yellow hen. \"There is no\\r\\nneed to beware of baby-cabs and wheelbarrows; but automobiles are\\r\\ndangerous things. Several of my friends have been run over by them.\"\\n\"It can\\'t be auto\\'biles,\" replied the girl, \"for this is a new, wild\\r\\ncountry, without even trolley-cars or tel\\'phones. The people here havn\\'t\\r\\nbeen discovered yet, I\\'m sure; that is, if there are any people. So I\\r\\ndon\\'t b\\'lieve there can be any auto\\'biles, Billina.\"\\n\"Perhaps not,\" admitted the yellow hen. \"Where are you going now?\"[Pg 39]\\n\\n\"Over to those trees, to see if I can find some fruit or nuts,\" answered\\r\\nDorothy.\\nShe tramped across the sand, skirting the foot of one of the little\\r\\nrocky hills that stood near, and soon reached the edge of the forest.\\nAt first she was greatly disappointed, because the nearer trees were all\\r\\npunita, or cotton-wood or eucalyptus, and bore no fruit or nuts at all.\\r\\nBut, bye and bye, when she was almost in despair, the little girl came\\r\\nupon two trees that promised to furnish her with plenty of food.\\nOne was quite full of square paper boxes, which grew in clusters on all\\r\\nthe limbs, and upon the biggest and ripest boxes the word \"Lunch\" could\\r\\nbe read, in neat raised letters. This tree seemed to bear all the year\\r\\naround, for there were lunch-box blossoms on some of the branches, and\\r\\non others tiny little lunch-boxes that were as yet quite green, and\\r\\nevidently not fit to eat until they had grown bigger.\\nThe leaves of this tree were all paper napkins, and it presented a very\\r\\npleasing appearance to the hungry little girl.\\nBut the tree next to the lunch-box tree was even more wonderful, for it\\r\\nbore quantities of tin dinner-pails, which were so full and heavy that\\r\\nthe stout[Pg 40] branches bent underneath their weight. Some were small and\\r\\ndark-brown in color; those larger were of a dull tin color; but the\\r\\nreally ripe ones were pails of bright tin that shone and glistened\\r\\nbeautifully in the rays of sunshine that touched them.\\nDorothy was delighted, and even the yellow hen acknowledged that she was\\r\\nsurprised.\\nThe little girl stood on tip-toe and picked one of the nicest and\\r\\nbiggest lunch-boxes, and then she sat down upon the ground and eagerly\\r\\nopened it. Inside she found, nicely wrapped in white papers, a ham\\r\\nsandwich, a piece of sponge-cake, a pickle, a slice of new cheese and an\\r\\napple. Each thing had a separate stem, and so had to be picked off the\\r\\nside of the box; but Dorothy found them all to be delicious, and she ate\\r\\nevery bit of luncheon in the box before she had finished.\\n\"A lunch isn\\'t zactly breakfast,\" she said to Billina, who sat beside\\r\\nher curiously watching. \"But when one is hungry one can eat even supper\\r\\nin the morning, and not complain.\"\\n\"I hope your lunch-box was perfectly ripe,\" observed the yellow hen, in a\\r\\nanxious tone. \"So much sickness is caused by eating green things.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE LITTLE GIRL PICKED ONE OF THE LUNCH-BOXES\\n\\n\"Oh, I\\'m sure it was ripe,\" declared Dorothy, \"all, that is, \\'cept the\\r\\npickle, and a pickle just has[Pg 42][Pg 41] to be green, Billina. But everything\\r\\ntasted perfectly splendid, and I\\'d rather have it than a church picnic.\\r\\nAnd now I think I\\'ll pick a dinner-pail, to have when I get hungry\\r\\nagain, and then we\\'ll start out and \\'splore the country, and see where\\r\\nwe are.\"\\n\"Havn\\'t you any idea what country this is?\" inquired Billina.\\n\"None at all. But listen: I\\'m quite sure it\\'s a fairy country, or such\\r\\nthings as lunch-boxes and dinner-pails wouldn\\'t be growing upon trees.\\r\\nBesides, Billina, being a hen, you wouldn\\'t be able to talk in any\\r\\nciv\\'lized country, like Kansas, where no fairies live at all.\"\\n\"Perhaps we\\'re in the Land of Oz,\" said the hen, thoughtfully.\\n\"No, that can\\'t be,\" answered the little girl; \"because I\\'ve been to the\\r\\nLand of Oz, and it\\'s all surrounded by a horrid desert that no one can\\r\\ncross.\"\\n\"Then how did you get away from there again?\" asked Billina.\\n\"I had a pair of silver shoes, that carried me through the air; but I\\r\\nlost them,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Ah, indeed,\" remarked the yellow hen, in a tone of unbelief.\\n\"Anyhow,\" resumed the girl, \"there is no sea[Pg 43]shore near the Land of Oz,\\r\\nso this must surely be some other fairy country.\"\\nWhile she was speaking she selected a bright and pretty dinner-pail\\r\\nthat seemed to have a stout handle, and picked it from its branch. Then,\\r\\naccompanied by the yellow hen, she walked out of the shadow of the trees\\r\\ntoward the sea-shore.\\nThey were part way across the sands when Billina suddenly cried, in a\\r\\nvoice of terror:\\n\"What\\'s that?\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 44]\\nDorothy turned quickly around, and saw coming out of a path that led\\r\\nfrom between the trees the most peculiar person her eyes had ever\\r\\nbeheld.\\nIt had the form of a man, except that it walked, or rather rolled, upon\\r\\nall fours, and its legs were the same length as its arms, giving them\\r\\nthe appearance of the four legs of a beast. Yet it was no beast that\\r\\nDorothy had discovered, for the person was clothed most gorgeously in\\r\\nembroidered garments of many colors, and wore a straw hat perched\\r\\njauntily upon the side of its head. But it differed from human beings in\\r\\nthis respect, that instead of hands and feet there grew at the end of\\r\\nits arms and legs round wheels, and by means of these wheels it rolled\\r\\nvery swiftly over the level ground. Afterward Dorothy found that these\\r\\nodd wheels were of the same hard substance that our finger-nails and\\r\\ntoe-nails are composed of, and she also learned that creatures of this\\r\\nstrange race were born in this queer fashion. But when our little girl\\r\\nfirst caught sight of the first individual of a race that was destined\\r\\nto cause her a lot of trouble, she had an idea that the\\r\\nbrilliantly-clothed personage was on roller-skates, which were attached\\r\\nto his hands as well as to his feet.\\n\"Run!\" screamed the yellow hen, fluttering away in great fright. \"It\\'s a\\r\\nWheeler!\"[Pg 45]\\n\\n\\n\"IT\\'S A WHEELER!\"\\n[Pg 46]\\n\"A Wheeler?\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"What can that be?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you remember the warning in the sand: \\'Beware the Wheelers\\'? Run,\\r\\nI tell you—run!\"\\nSo Dorothy ran, and the Wheeler gave a sharp, wild cry and came after\\r\\nher in full chase.\\nLooking over her shoulder as she ran, the girl now saw a great\\r\\nprocession of Wheelers emerging from the forest—dozens and dozens of\\r\\nthem—all clad in splendid, tight-fitting garments and all rolling\\r\\nswiftly toward her and uttering their wild, strange cries.\\n\"They\\'re sure to catch us!\" panted the girl, who was still carrying the\\r\\nheavy dinner-pail she had picked. \"I can\\'t run much farther, Billina.\"\\n\"Climb up this hill,—quick!\" said the hen; and Dorothy found she was\\r\\nvery near to the heap of loose and jagged rocks they had passed on their\\r\\nway to the forest. The yellow hen was even now fluttering among the\\r\\nrocks, and Dorothy followed as best she could, half climbing and half\\r\\ntumbling up the rough and rugged steep.\\nShe was none too soon, for the foremost Wheeler reached the hill a\\r\\nmoment after her; but while the girl scrambled up the rocks the creature\\r\\nstopped short with howls of rage and disappointment.[Pg 47]\\nDorothy now heard the yellow hen laughing, in her cackling, henny way.\\n\"Don\\'t hurry, my dear,\" cried Billina. \"They can\\'t follow us among these\\r\\nrocks, so we\\'re safe enough now.\"\\nDorothy stopped at once and sat down upon a broad boulder, for she was\\r\\nall out of breath.\\nThe rest of the Wheelers had now reached the foot of the hill, but it\\r\\nwas evident that their wheels would not roll upon the rough and jagged\\r\\nrocks, and therefore they were helpless to follow Dorothy and the hen to\\r\\nwhere they had taken refuge. But they circled all around the little\\r\\nhill, so the child and Billina were fast prisoners and could not come\\r\\ndown without being captured.\\nThen the creatures shook their front wheels at Dorothy in a threatening\\r\\nmanner, and it seemed they were able to speak as well as to make their\\r\\ndreadful outcries, for several of them shouted:\\n\"We\\'ll get you in time, never fear! And when we do get you, we\\'ll tear\\r\\nyou into little bits!\"\\n\"Why are you so cruel to me?\" asked Dorothy. \"I\\'m a stranger in your\\r\\ncountry, and have done you no harm.\"\\n\"No harm!\" cried one who seemed to be their leader. \"Did you not pick\\r\\nour lunch-boxes and[Pg 48] dinner-pails? Have you not a stolen dinner-pail\\r\\nstill in your hand?\"\\n\"I only picked one of each,\" she answered. \"I was hungry, and I didn\\'t\\r\\nknow the trees were yours.\"\\n\"That is no excuse,\" retorted the leader, who was clothed in a most\\r\\ngorgeous suit. \"It is the law here that whoever picks a dinner-pail\\r\\nwithout our permission must die immediately.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you believe him,\" said Billina. \"I\\'m sure the trees do not belong\\r\\nto these awful creatures. They are fit for any mischief, and it\\'s my\\r\\nopinion they would try to kill us just the same if you hadn\\'t picked a\\r\\ndinner-pail.\"\\n\"I think so, too,\" agreed Dorothy. \"But what shall we do now?\"\\n\"Stay where we are,\" advised the yellow hen. \"We are safe from the\\r\\nWheelers until we starve to death, anyhow; and before that time comes a\\r\\ngood many things can happen.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 49]\\n\\nTiktok the Machine Man\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAfter an hour or so most of the band of Wheelers rolled back into the\\r\\nforest, leaving only three of their number to guard the hill. These\\r\\ncurled themselves up like big dogs and pretended to go to sleep on the\\r\\nsands; but neither Dorothy nor Billina were fooled by this trick, so\\r\\nthey remained in security among the rocks and paid no attention to their\\r\\ncunning enemies.\\nFinally the hen, fluttering over the mound, exclaimed: \"Why, here\\'s a\\r\\npath!\"\\nSo Dorothy at once clambered to where Billina sat, and there, sure\\r\\nenough, was a smooth path[Pg 50] cut between the rocks. It seemed to wind\\r\\naround the mound from top to bottom, like a cork-screw, twisting here\\r\\nand there between the rough boulders but always remaining level and easy\\r\\nto walk upon.\\nIndeed, Dorothy wondered at first why the Wheelers did not roll up this\\r\\npath; but when she followed it to the foot of the mound she found that\\r\\nseveral big pieces of rock had been placed directly across the end of\\r\\nthe way, thus preventing any one outside from seeing it and also\\r\\npreventing the Wheelers from using it to climb up the mound.\\nThen Dorothy walked back up the path, and followed it until she came to\\r\\nthe very top of the hill, where a solitary round rock stood that was\\r\\nbigger than any of the others surrounding it. The path came to an end\\r\\njust beside this great rock, and for a moment it puzzled the girl to\\r\\nknow why the path had been made at all. But the hen, who had been\\r\\ngravely following her around and was now perched upon a point of rock\\r\\nbehind Dorothy, suddenly remarked:\\n\"It looks something like a door, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\"What looks like a door?\" enquired the child.\\n\"Why, that crack in the rock, just facing you,\" replied Billina, whose\\r\\nlittle round eyes were very sharp and seemed to see everything. \"It runs\\r\\nup[Pg 51] one side and down the other, and across the top and the bottom.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What does?\"\\n\"Why, the crack. So I think it must be a door of rock, although I do not\\r\\nsee any hinges.\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" said Dorothy, now observing for the first time the crack in\\r\\nthe rock. \"And isn\\'t this a key-hole, Billina?\" pointing to a round,\\r\\ndeep hole at one side of the door.\\n\"Of course. If we only had the key, now, we[Pg 52] could unlock it and see\\r\\nwhat is there,\" replied the yellow hen. \"May be it\\'s a treasure chamber\\r\\nfull of diamonds and rubies, or heaps of shining gold, or——\"\\n\"That reminds me,\" said Dorothy, \"of the golden key I picked up on the\\r\\nshore. Do you think that it would fit this key-hole, Billina?\"\\n\"Try it and see,\" suggested the hen.\\nSo Dorothy searched in the pocket of her dress and found the golden key.\\r\\nAnd when she had put it into the hole of the rock, and turned it, a\\r\\nsudden sharp snap was heard; then, with a solemn creak that made the\\r\\nshivers run down the child\\'s back, the face of the rock fell outward,\\r\\nlike a door on hinges, and revealed a small dark chamber just inside.\\n\"Good gracious!\" cried Dorothy, shrinking back as far as the narrow path\\r\\nwould let her.\\nFor, standing within the narrow chamber of rock, was the form of a\\r\\nman—or, at least, it seemed like a man, in the dim light. He was only\\r\\nabout as tall as Dorothy herself, and his body was round as a ball and\\r\\nmade out of burnished copper. Also his head and limbs were copper, and\\r\\nthese were jointed or hinged to his body in a peculiar way, with metal\\r\\ncaps over the joints, like the armor worn by knights in days of old. He\\r\\nstood perfectly still, and where[Pg 54][Pg 53] the light struck upon his form it\\r\\nglittered as if made of pure gold.\\n\\n\\n\"THIS COPPER MAN IS NOT ALIVE AT ALL\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t be frightened,\" called Billina, from her perch. \"It isn\\'t alive.\"\\n\"I see it isn\\'t,\" replied the girl, drawing a long breath.\\n\"It is only made out of copper, like the old kettle in the barn-yard at\\r\\nhome,\" continued the hen, turning her head first to one side and then to\\r\\nthe other, so that both her little round eyes could examine the object.\\n\"Once,\" said Dorothy, \"I knew a man made out of tin, who was a woodman\\r\\nnamed Nick Chopper. But he was as alive as we are, \\'cause he was born a\\r\\nreal man, and got his tin body a little at a time—first a leg and then\\r\\na finger and then an ear—for the reason that he had so many accidents\\r\\nwith his axe, and cut himself up in a very careless manner.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said the hen, with a sniff, as if she did not believe the story.\\n\"But this copper man,\" continued Dorothy, looking at it with big eyes,\\r\\n\"is not alive at all, and I wonder what it was made for, and why it was\\r\\nlocked up in this queer place.\"\\n\"That is a mystery,\" remarked the hen, twisting her head to arrange her\\r\\nwing-feathers with her bill.[Pg 55]\\nDorothy stepped inside the little room to get a back view of the copper\\r\\nman, and in this way discovered a printed card that hung between his\\r\\nshoulders, it being suspended from a small copper peg at the back of his\\r\\nneck. She unfastened this card and returned to the path, where the light\\r\\nwas better, and sat herself down upon a slab of rock to read the\\r\\nprinting.\\n\"What does it say?\" asked the hen, curiously.\\nDorothy read the card aloud, spelling out the big words with some\\r\\ndifficulty; and this is what she read:\\n\\nSMITH & TINKER\\'S\\nPatent Double-Action, Extra-Responsive,\\r\\n    Thought-Creating, Perfect-Talking\\nMECHANICAL MAN\\nFitted with our Special Clock-Work Attachment.\\r\\n    Thinks, Speaks, Acts, and Does Everything but Live.\\nManufactured only at our Works at Evna, Land of Ev.\\r\\n    All infringements will be promptly Prosecuted according to Law.\\n\\n\"How queer!\" said the yellow hen. \"Do you think that is all true, my\\r\\ndear?\"[Pg 56]\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" answered Dorothy, who had more to read. \"Listen to this,\\r\\nBillina:\"\\n\\nDIRECTIONS FOR USING:\\nFor THINKING:—Wind the Clock-work Man under his\\r\\n    left arm, (marked No. 1.)\\nFor SPEAKING:—Wind the Clock-work Man under his\\r\\n    right arm, (marked No. 2.)\\nFor WALKING and ACTION:—Wind Clock-work in the\\r\\n    middle of his back, (marked No. 3.)\\nN. B.—This Mechanism is guaranteed to work perfectly for a thousand years.\\n\\n\"Well, I declare!\" gasped the yellow hen, in amazement; \"if the copper\\r\\nman can do half of these things he is a very wonderful machine. But I\\r\\nsuppose it is all humbug, like so many other patented articles.\"\\n\"We might wind him up,\" suggested Dorothy, \"and see what he\\'ll do.\"\\n\"Where is the key to the clock-work?\" asked Billina.\\n\"Hanging on the peg where I found the card.\"\\n\"Then,\" said the hen, \"let us try him, and find out if he will go. He is\\r\\nwarranted for a thousand years, it seems; but we do not know how long he\\r\\nhas been standing inside this rock.\"\\nDorothy had already taken the clock key from the peg.[Pg 57]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY WOUND UP NUMBER ONE\\n[Pg 58]\\n\"Which shall I wind up first?\" she asked, looking again at the\\r\\ndirections on the card.\\n\"Number One, I should think,\" returned Billina. \"That makes him think,\\r\\ndoesn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Dorothy, and wound up Number One, under the left arm.\\n\"He doesn\\'t seem any different,\" remarked the hen, critically.\\n\"Why, of course not; he is only thinking, now,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"I wonder what he is thinking about.\"\\n\"I\\'ll wind up his talk, and then perhaps he can tell us,\" said the girl.\\nSo she wound up Number Two, and immediately the clock-work man said,\\r\\nwithout moving any part of his body except his lips:\\n\"Good morn-ing, lit-tle girl. Good morn-ing, Mrs. Hen.\"\\nThe words sounded a little hoarse and creakey, and they were uttered all\\r\\nin the same tone, without any change of expression whatever; but both\\r\\nDorothy and Billina understood them perfectly.\\n\"Good morning, sir,\" they answered, politely.\\n\"Thank you for res-cu-ing me,\" continued the machine, in the same\\r\\nmonotonous voice, which[Pg 59] seemed to be worked by a bellows inside of him,\\r\\nlike the little toy lambs and cats the children squeeze so that they\\r\\nwill make a noise.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Don\\'t mention it,\" answered Dorothy. And then, being very curious, she\\r\\nasked: \"How did you come to be locked up in this place?\"\\n\"It is a long sto-ry,\" replied the copper man; \"but I will tell it to\\r\\nyou brief-ly. I was pur-chased from Smith & Tin-ker, my\\r\\nman-u-fac-tur-ers, by a cru-el King of Ev, named Ev-ol-do, who used to[Pg 60]\\r\\nbeat all his serv-ants un-til they died. How-ev-er, he was not a-ble to\\r\\nkill me, be-cause I was not a-live, and one must first live in or-der to\\r\\ndie. So that all his beat-ing did me no harm, and mere-ly kept my\\r\\ncop-per bod-y well pol-ished.\\n\"This cru-el king had a love-ly wife and ten beau-ti-ful chil-dren—five\\r\\nboys and five girls—but in a fit of an-ger he sold them all to the Nome\\r\\nKing, who by means of his mag-ic arts changed them all in-to oth-er\\r\\nforms and put them in his un-der-ground pal-ace to or-na-ment the rooms.\\n\"Af-ter-ward the King of Ev re-gret-ted his wick-ed ac-tion, and tried\\r\\nto get his wife and chil-dren a-way from the Nome King, but with-out\\r\\na-vail. So, in de-spair, he locked me up in this rock, threw the key\\r\\nin-to the o-cean, and then jumped in af-ter it and was drowned.\"\\n\"How very dreadful!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\"It is, in-deed,\" said the machine. \"When I found my-self im-pris-oned I\\r\\nshout-ed for help un-til my voice ran down; and then I walked back and\\r\\nforth in this lit-tle room un-til my ac-tion ran down; and then I stood\\r\\nstill and thought un-til my thoughts ran down. Af-ter that I re-mem-ber\\r\\nnoth-ing un-til you wound me up a-gain.\"\\n\"It\\'s a very wonderful story,\" said Dorothy, \"and[Pg 62][Pg 61] proves that the Land\\r\\nof Ev is really a fairy land, as I thought it was.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE COPPER MAN WALKED OUT OF THE ROCKY CAVERN\\n\\n\"Of course it is,\" answered the copper man. \"I do not sup-pose such a\\r\\nper-fect ma-chine as I am could be made in an-y place but a fair-y\\r\\nland.\"\\n\"I\\'ve never seen one in Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"But where did you get the key to un-lock this door?\" asked the\\r\\nclock-work voice.\\n\"I found it on the shore, where it was prob\\'ly washed up by the waves,\"\\r\\nshe answered. \"And now, sir, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll wind up your\\r\\naction.\"\\n\"That will please me ve-ry much,\" said the machine.\\nSo she wound up Number Three, and at once the copper man in a somewhat\\r\\nstiff and jerky fashion walked out of the rocky cavern, took off his\\r\\ncopper hat and bowed politely, and then kneeled before Dorothy. Said he:\\n\"From this time forth I am your o-be-di-ent ser-vant. What-ev-er you\\r\\ncom-mand, that I will do will-ing-ly—if you keep me wound up.\"\\n\"What is your name?\" she asked.\\n\"Tik-tok,\" he replied. \"My for-mer mas-ter gave me that name be-cause my\\r\\nclock-work al-ways ticks when it is wound up.\"\\n\"I can hear it now,\" said the yellow hen.\\n\"So can I,\" said Dorothy. And then she added,[Pg 63] with some anxiety: \"You\\r\\ndon\\'t strike, do you?\"\\n\"No,\" answered Tiktok; \"and there is no a-larm con-nec-ted with my\\r\\nma-chin-er-y. I can tell the time, though, by speak-ing, and as I nev-er\\r\\nsleep I can wak-en you at an-y hour you wish to get up in the morn-ing.\"\\n\"That\\'s nice,\" said the little girl; \"only I never wish to get up in the\\r\\nmorning.\"\\n\"You can sleep until I lay my egg,\" said the yellow hen. \"Then, when I\\r\\ncackle, Tiktok will know it is time to waken you.\"\\n\"Do you lay your egg very early?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"About eight o\\'clock,\" said Billina. \"And everybody ought to be up by\\r\\nthat time, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 64]\\n\\nDorothy Opens the Dinner Pail\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\"Now Tiktok,\" said Dorothy, \"the first thing to be done is to find a way\\r\\nfor us to escape from these rocks. The Wheelers are down below, you\\r\\nknow, and threaten to kill us.\"\\n\"There is no rea-son to be a-fraid of the Wheel-ers,\" said Tiktok, the\\r\\nwords coming more slowly than before.\\n\"Why not?\" she asked.\\n\"Be-cause they are ag-g-g—gr-gr-r-r-\"\\nHe gave a sort of gurgle and stopped short, waving his hands frantically\\r\\nuntil suddenly he became motionless, with one arm in the air and the\\r\\nother held stiffly before him with all the copper fingers of the hand\\r\\nspread out like a fan.[Pg 65]\\n\"Dear me!\" said Dorothy, in a frightened tone. \"What can the matter be?\"\\n\"He\\'s run down, I suppose,\" said the hen, calmly. \"You couldn\\'t have\\r\\nwound him up very tight.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t know how much to wind him,\" replied the girl; \"but I\\'ll try to\\r\\ndo better next time.\"\\nShe ran around the copper man to take the key from the peg at the back\\r\\nof his neck, but it was not there.\\n\"It\\'s gone!\" cried Dorothy, in dismay.\\n\"What\\'s gone?\" asked Billina.\\n\"The key.\"\\n\"It probably fell off when he made that low bow to you,\" returned the\\r\\nhen. \"Look around, and see if you cannot find it again.\"\\nDorothy looked, and the hen helped her, and by and by the girl\\r\\ndiscovered the clock-key, which had fallen into a crack of the rock.\\n\\nAt once she wound up Tiktok\\'s voice, taking care to give the key as many\\r\\nturns as it would go around. She found this quite a task, as you may\\r\\nimagine if you have ever tried to wind a clock, but the machine man\\'s\\r\\nfirst words were to assure Dorothy that he would now run for at least\\r\\ntwenty-four hours.\\n\"You did not wind me much, at first,\" he calmly said, \"and I told you\\r\\nthat long sto-ry a-bout King[Pg 66] Ev-ol-do; so it is no won-der that I ran\\r\\ndown.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShe next rewound the action clock-work, and then Billina advised her to\\r\\ncarry the key to Tiktok in her pocket, so it would not get lost again.\\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, when all this was accomplished, \"tell me what\\r\\nyou were going to say about the Wheelers.\"\\n\"Why, they are noth-ing to be fright-en\\'d at,\" said the machine. \"They\\r\\ntry to make folks be-lieve that they are ver-y ter-ri-ble, but as a\\r\\nmat-ter of[Pg 67] fact the Wheel-ers are harm-less e-nough to an-y one that\\r\\ndares to fight them. They might try to hurt a lit-tle girl like you,\\r\\nper-haps, be-cause they are ver-y mis-chiev-ous. But if I had a club\\r\\nthey would run a-way as soon as they saw me.\"\\n\"Haven\\'t you a club?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"No,\" said Tiktok.\\n\"And you won\\'t find such a thing among these rocks, either,\" declared\\r\\nthe yellow hen.\\n\"Then what shall we do?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Wind up my think-works tight-ly, and I will try to think of some oth-er\\r\\nplan,\" said Tiktok.\\nSo Dorothy rewound his thought machinery, and while he was thinking she\\r\\ndecided to eat her dinner. Billina was already pecking away at the\\r\\ncracks in the rocks, to find something to eat, so Dorothy sat down and\\r\\nopened her tin dinner-pail.\\nIn the cover she found a small tank that was full of very nice lemonade.\\r\\nIt was covered by a cup, which might also, when removed, be used to\\r\\ndrink the lemonade from. Within the pail were three slices of turkey,\\r\\ntwo slices of cold tongue, some lobster salad, four slices of bread and\\r\\nbutter, a small custard pie, an orange and nine large strawberries, and\\r\\nsome nuts and raisins. Singularly enough, the nuts in this dinner-pail\\r\\ngrew already cracked, so that[Pg 68] Dorothy had no trouble in picking out\\r\\ntheir meats to eat.\\nShe spread the feast upon the rock beside her and began her dinner,\\r\\nfirst offering some of it to Tiktok, who declined because, as he said,\\r\\nhe was merely a machine. Afterward she offered to share with Billina,\\r\\nbut the hen murmured something about \"dead things\" and said she\\r\\npreferred her bugs and ants.\\n\"Do the lunch-box trees and the dinner-pail trees belong to the\\r\\nWheelers?\" the child asked Tiktok, while engaged in eating her meal.\\n\"Of course not,\" he answered. \"They be-long to the roy-al fam-il-y of\\r\\nEv, on-ly of course there is no roy-al fam-il-y just now be-cause King\\r\\nEv-ol-do jumped in-to the sea and his wife and ten chil-dren have been\\r\\ntrans-formed by the Nome King. So there is no one to rule the Land of\\r\\nEv, that I can think of. Per-haps it is for this rea-son that the\\r\\nWheel-ers claim the trees for their own, and pick the lunch-eons and\\r\\ndin-ners to eat them-selves. But they be-long to the King, and you will\\r\\nfind the roy-al \"E\" stamped up-on the bot-tom of ev-er-y din-ner pail.\"\\nDorothy turned the pail over, and at once discovered the royal mark upon\\r\\nit, as Tiktok had said.\\n\"Are the Wheelers the only folks living in the Land of Ev?\" enquired the\\r\\ngirl.[Pg 69]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY OPENED HER TIN DINNER-PAIL\\n[Pg 70]\\n\"No; they on-ly in-hab-it a small por-tion of it just back of the\\r\\nwoods,\" replied the machine. \"But they have al-ways been mis-chiev-ous\\r\\nand im-per-ti-nent, and my old mas-ter, King Ev-ol-do, used to car-ry a\\r\\nwhip with him, when he walked out, to keep the crea-tures in or-der.\\r\\nWhen I was first made the Wheel-ers tried to run o-ver me, and butt me\\r\\nwith their heads; but they soon found I was built of too sol-id a\\r\\nma-ter-i-al for them to in-jure.\"\\n\"You seem very durable,\" said Dorothy. \"Who made you?\"\\n\"The firm of Smith & Tin-ker, in the town of Ev-na, where the roy-al\\r\\npal-ace stands,\" answered Tiktok.\\n\"Did they make many of you?\" asked the child.\\n\"No; I am the on-ly au-to-mat-ic me-chan-i-cal man they ev-er\\r\\ncom-plet-ed,\" he replied. \"They were ver-y won-der-ful in-ven-tors, were\\r\\nmy mak-ers, and quite ar-tis-tic in all they did.\"\\n\"I am sure of that,\" said Dorothy. \"Do they live in the town of Evna\\r\\nnow?\"\\n\"They are both gone,\" replied the machine. \"Mr. Smith was an art-ist, as\\r\\nwell as an in-vent-or, and he paint-ed a pic-ture of a riv-er which was\\r\\nso nat-ur-al that, as he was reach-ing a-cross it to paint some flow-ers\\r\\non the op-po-site bank, he fell in-to the wa-ter and was drowned.\"[Pg 71]\\n\"Oh, I\\'m sorry for that!\" exclaimed the little girl.\\n\"Mis-ter Tin-ker,\" continued Tiktok, \"made a lad-der so tall that he\\r\\ncould rest the end of it a-gainst the moon, while he stood on the\\r\\nhigh-est rung and picked the lit-tle stars to set in the points of the\\r\\nking\\'s crown. But when he got to the moon Mis-ter Tin-ker found it such\\r\\na love-ly place that he de-cid-ed to live there, so he pulled up the\\r\\nlad-der af-ter him and we have nev-er seen him since.\"\\n\"He must have been a great loss to this country,\" said Dorothy, who was\\r\\nby this time eating her custard pie.\\n\"He was,\" acknowledged Tiktok. \"Also he is a great loss to me. For if I\\r\\nshould get out of or-der I do not know of an-y one a-ble to re-pair me,\\r\\nbe-cause I am so com-pli-cat-ed. You have no i-de-a how full of\\r\\nma-chin-er-y I am.\"\\n\"I can imagine it,\" said Dorothy, readily.\\n\"And now,\" continued the machine, \"I must stop talk-ing and be-gin\\r\\nthink-ing a-gain of a way to es-cape from this rock.\" So he turned\\r\\nhalfway around, in order to think without being disturbed.\\n\"The best thinker I ever knew,\" said Dorothy to the yellow hen, \"was a\\r\\nscarecrow.\"\\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped Billina.\\n\"It is true,\" declared Dorothy. \"I met him in[Pg 72] the Land of Oz, and he\\r\\ntravelled with me to the city of the great Wizard of Oz, so as to get\\r\\nsome brains, for his head was only stuffed with straw. But it seemed to\\r\\nme that he thought just as well before he got his brains as he did\\r\\nafterward.\"\\n\"Do you expect me to believe all that rubbish about the Land of Oz?\"\\r\\nenquired Billina, who seemed a little cross—perhaps because bugs were\\r\\nscarce.\\n\"What rubbish?\" asked the child, who was now finishing her nuts and\\r\\nraisins.\\n\"Why, your impossible stories about animals that can talk, and a tin\\r\\nwoodman who is alive, and a scarecrow who can think.\"\\n\"They are all there,\" said Dorothy, \"for I have seen them.\"\\n\"I don\\'t believe it!\" cried the hen, with a toss of her head.\\n\"That\\'s \\'cause you\\'re so ign\\'rant,\" replied the girl, who was a little\\r\\noffended at her friend Billina\\'s speech.\\n\"In the Land of Oz,\" remarked Tiktok, turning toward them, \"an-y-thing\\r\\nis pos-si-ble. For it is a won-der-ful fair-y coun-try.\"\\n\"There, Billina! what did I say?\" cried Dorothy. And then she turned to\\r\\nthe machine and asked in an eager tone: \"Do you know the Land of Oz,\\r\\nTiktok?\"[Pg 73]\\n\\n\\nMISTER TINKER VISITS THE MOON\\n[Pg 74]\\n\"No; but I have heard a-bout it,\" said the copper man. \"For it is on-ly\\r\\nsep-a-ra-ted from this Land of Ev by a broad des-ert.\"\\nDorothy clapped her hands together delightedly.\\n\"I\\'m glad of that!\" she exclaimed. \"It makes me quite happy to be so\\r\\nnear my old friends. The scarecrow I told you of, Billina, is the King\\r\\nof the Land of Oz.\"\\n\"Par-don me. He is not the king now,\" said Tiktok.\\n\"He was when I left there,\" declared Dorothy.\\n\"I know,\" said Tiktok, \"but there was a rev-o-lu-tion in the Land of Oz,\\r\\nand the Scare-crow was de-posed by a sol-dier wo-man named Gen-er-al\\r\\nJin-jur. And then Jin-jur was de-posed by a lit-tle girl named Oz-ma,\\r\\nwho was the right-ful heir to the throne and now rules the land un-der\\r\\nthe ti-tle of Oz-ma of Oz.\"\\n\"That is news to me,\" said Dorothy, thoughtfully. \"But I s\\'pose lots of\\r\\nthings have happened since I left the Land of Oz. I wonder what has\\r\\nbecome of the Scarecrow, and of the Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion.\\r\\nAnd I wonder who this girl Ozma is, for I never heard of her before.\"\\nBut Tiktok did not reply to this. He had turned around again to resume\\r\\nhis thinking.[Pg 75]\\nDorothy packed the rest of the food back into the pail, so as not to be\\r\\nwasteful of good things, and the yellow hen forgot her dignity far\\r\\nenough to pick up all of the scattered crumbs, which she ate rather\\r\\ngreedily, although she had so lately pretended to despise the things\\r\\nthat Dorothy preferred as food.\\nBy this time Tiktok approached them with his stiff bow.\\n\"Be kind e-nough to fol-low me,\" he said, \"and I will lead you a-way\\r\\nfrom here to the town of Ev-na, where you will be more com-for-ta-ble,\\r\\nand also I will pro-tect you from the Wheel-ers.\"\\n\"All right,\" answered Dorothy, promptly. \"I\\'m ready!\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 76]\\n\\nThe Heads of Langwidere\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThey walked slowly down the path between the rocks, Tiktok going first,\\r\\nDorothy following him, and the yellow hen trotting along last of all.\\nAt the foot of the path the copper man leaned down and tossed aside with\\r\\nease the rocks that cumbered the way. Then he turned to Dorothy and\\r\\nsaid:\\n\"Let me car-ry your din-ner-pail.\"\\nShe placed it in his right hand at once, and the copper fingers closed\\r\\nfirmly over the stout handle.\\nThen the little procession marched out upon the level sands.[Pg 77]\\nAs soon as the three Wheelers who were guarding the mound saw them, they\\r\\nbegan to shout their wild cries and rolled swiftly toward the little\\r\\ngroup, as if to capture them or bar their way. But when the foremost had\\r\\napproached near enough, Tiktok swung the tin dinner-pail and struck the\\r\\nWheeler a sharp blow over its head with the queer weapon. Perhaps it did\\r\\nnot hurt very much, but it made a great noise, and the Wheeler uttered a\\r\\nhowl and tumbled over upon its side. The next minute it scrambled to its\\r\\nwheels and rolled away as fast as it could go, screeching with fear at\\r\\nthe same time.\\n\"I told you they were harm-less,\" began Tiktok; but before he could say\\r\\nmore another Wheeler was upon them. Crack! went the dinner-pail against\\r\\nits head, knocking its straw hat a dozen feet away; and that was enough\\r\\nfor this Wheeler, also. It rolled away after the first one, and the\\r\\nthird did not wait to be pounded with the pail, but joined its fellows\\r\\nas quickly as its wheels would whirl.\\nThe yellow hen gave a cackle of delight, and flying to a perch upon\\r\\nTiktok\\'s shoulder, she said:\\n\"Bravely done, my copper friend! and wisely thought of, too. Now we are\\r\\nfree from those ugly creatures.\"\\nBut just then a large band of Wheelers rolled[Pg 78] from the forest, and\\r\\nrelying upon their numbers to conquer, they advanced fiercely upon\\r\\nTiktok. Dorothy grabbed Billina in her arms and held her tight, and the\\r\\nmachine embraced the form of the little girl with his left arm, the\\r\\nbetter to protect her. Then the Wheelers were upon them.\\n\\nRattlety, bang! bang! went the dinner-pail in every direction, and it\\r\\nmade so much clatter bumping against the heads of the Wheelers that they\\r\\nwere much more frightened than hurt and fled in a great panic. All, that\\r\\nis, except their leader. This Wheeler had stumbled against another and\\r\\nfallen flat upon his back, and before he could get his wheels under him\\r\\nto rise again, Tiktok had fastened his copper fingers into the neck of\\r\\nthe gorgeous jacket of his foe and held him fast.\\n\"Tell your peo-ple to go a-way,\" commanded the machine.\\nThe leader of the Wheelers hesitated to give this order, so Tiktok shook\\r\\nhim as a terrier dog does a rat, until the Wheeler\\'s teeth rattled\\r\\ntogether with a noise like hailstones on a window pane. Then, as soon as\\r\\nthe creature could get its breath, it shouted to the others to roll\\r\\naway, which they immediately did.\\n\"Now,\" said Tiktok, \"you shall come with us and tell me what I want to\\r\\nknow.\"[Pg 79]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"You\\'ll be sorry for treating me in this way,\" whined the Wheeler. \"I\\'m\\r\\na terribly fierce person.\"\\n\"As for that,\" answered Tiktok, \"I am only a ma-chine, and can-not feel\\r\\nsor-row or joy, no mat-ter what hap-pens. But you are wrong to think\\r\\nyour-self ter-ri-ble or fierce.\"\\n\"Why so?\" asked the Wheeler.\\n\"Be-cause no one else thinks as you do. Your wheels make you help-less\\r\\nto in-jure an-y one. For you have no fists and can not scratch or e-ven\\r\\npull[Pg 80] hair. Nor have you an-y feet to kick with. All you can do is to\\r\\nyell and shout, and that does not hurt an-y one at all.\"\\nThe Wheeler burst into a flood of tears, to Dorothy\\'s great surprise.\\n\"Now I and my people are ruined forever!\" he sobbed; \"for you have\\r\\ndiscovered our secret. Being so helpless, our only hope is to make\\r\\npeople afraid of us, by pretending we are very fierce and terrible, and\\r\\nwriting in the sand warnings to Beware the Wheelers. Until now we have\\r\\nfrightened everyone, but since you have discovered our weakness our\\r\\nenemies will fall upon us and make us very miserable and unhappy.\"\\n\"Oh, no,\" exclaimed Dorothy, who was sorry to see this beautifully\\r\\ndressed Wheeler so miserable; \"Tiktok will keep your secret, and so will\\r\\nBillina and I. Only, you must promise not to try to frighten children\\r\\nany more, if they come near to you.\"\\n\"I won\\'t—indeed I won\\'t!\" promised the Wheeler, ceasing to cry and\\r\\nbecoming more cheerful. \"I\\'m not really bad, you know; but we have to\\r\\npretend to be terrible in order to prevent others from attacking us.\"\\n\\n\\nON THE WAY TO THE ROYAL PALACE OF EV\\n\\n\"That is not ex-act-ly true,\" said Tiktok, starting to walk toward the\\r\\npath through the forest, and[Pg 82][Pg 81] still holding fast to his prisoner, who\\r\\nrolled slowly along beside him. \"You and your peo-ple are full of\\r\\nmis-chief, and like to both-er those who fear you. And you are of-ten\\r\\nim-pu-dent and dis-a-gree-a-ble, too. But if you will try to cure those\\r\\nfaults I will not tell any-one how help-less you are.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try, of course,\" replied the Wheeler, eagerly. \"And thank you, Mr.\\r\\nTiktok, for your kindness.\"\\n\"I am on-ly a ma-chine,\" said Tiktok. \"I can not be kind an-y more than\\r\\nI can be sor-ry or glad. I can on-ly do what I am wound up to do.\"\\n\"Are you wound up to keep my secret?\" asked the Wheeler, anxiously.\\n\"Yes; if you be-have your-self. But tell me: who rules the Land of Ev\\r\\nnow?\" asked the machine.\\n\"There is no ruler,\" was the answer, \"because every member of the royal\\r\\nfamily is imprisoned by the Nome King. But the Princess Langwidere, who\\r\\nis a niece of our late King Evoldo, lives in a part of the royal palace\\r\\nand takes as much money out of the royal treasury as she can spend. The\\r\\nPrincess Langwidere is not exactly a ruler, you see, because she doesn\\'t\\r\\nrule; but she is the nearest approach to a ruler we have at present.\"\\n\"I do not re-mem-ber her,\" said Tiktok. \"What does she look like?\"[Pg 83]\\n\"That I cannot say,\" replied the Wheeler, \"although I have seen her\\r\\ntwenty times. For the Princess Langwidere is a different person every\\r\\ntime I see her, and the only way her subjects can recognize her at all\\r\\nis by means of a beautiful ruby key which she always wears on a chain\\r\\nattached to her left wrist. When we see the key we know we are beholding\\r\\nthe Princess.\"\\n\"That is strange,\" said Dorothy, in astonishment. \"Do you mean to say\\r\\nthat so many different princesses are one and the same person?\"\\n\"Not exactly,\" answered the Wheeler. \"There is, of course, but one\\r\\nprincess; but she appears to us in many forms, which are all more or\\r\\nless beautiful.\"\\n\"She must be a witch,\" exclaimed the girl.\\n\"I do not think so,\" declared the Wheeler. \"But there is some mystery\\r\\nconnected with her, nevertheless. She is a very vain creature, and lives\\r\\nmostly in a room surrounded by mirrors, so that she can admire herself\\r\\nwhichever way she looks.\"\\nNo one answered this speech, because they had just passed out of the\\r\\nforest and their attention was fixed upon the scene before them—a\\r\\nbeautiful vale in which were many fruit trees and green fields, with\\r\\npretty farm-houses scattered here and there and broad, smooth roads that\\r\\nled in every direction.[Pg 84]\\nIn the center of this lovely vale, about a mile from where our friends\\r\\nwere standing, rose the tall spires of the royal palace, which glittered\\r\\nbrightly against their background of blue sky. The palace was surrounded\\r\\nby charming grounds, full of flowers and shrubbery. Several tinkling\\r\\nfountains could be seen, and there were pleasant walks bordered by rows\\r\\nof white marble statuary.\\nAll these details Dorothy was, of course, unable to notice or admire\\r\\nuntil they had advanced along the road to a position quite near to the\\r\\npalace, and she was still looking at the pretty sights when her little\\r\\nparty entered the grounds and approached the big front door of the\\r\\nking\\'s own apartments. To their disappointment they found the door\\r\\ntightly closed. A sign was tacked to the panel which read as follows:\\n\\nOWNER ABSENT.\\nPlease Knock at the Third Door in the Left Wing.\\n\"Now,\" said Tiktok to the captive Wheeler, \"you must show us the way to\\r\\nthe Left Wing.\"[Pg 85]\\n\\n\\nA SIGN WAS TACKED TO THE PANEL\\n\\n[Pg 86]\\n\"Very well,\" agreed the prisoner, \"it is around here at the right.\"\\n\"How can the left wing be at the right?\" demanded Dorothy, who feared\\r\\nthe Wheeler was fooling them.\\n\"Because there used to be three wings, and two were torn down, so the\\r\\none on the right is the only one left. It is a trick of the Princess\\r\\nLangwidere to prevent visitors from annoying her.\"\\nThen the captive led them around to the wing, after which the machine\\r\\nman, having no further use for the Wheeler, permitted him to depart and\\r\\nrejoin his fellows. He immediately rolled away at a great pace and was\\r\\nsoon lost to sight.\\nTiktok now counted the doors in the wing and knocked loudly upon the\\r\\nthird one.\\nIt was opened by a little maid in a cap trimmed with gay ribbons, who\\r\\nbowed respectfully and asked:\\n\"What do you wish, good people?\"\\n\"Are you the Princess Langwidere?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"No, miss; I am her servant,\" replied the maid.\\n\"May I see the Princess, please?\"\\n\"I will tell her you are here, miss, and ask her to grant you an\\r\\naudience,\" said the maid. \"Step in, please, and take a seat in the\\r\\ndrawing-room.\"[Pg 87]\\n\\n\\n\\nSo Dorothy walked in, followed closely by the machine. But as the yellow\\r\\nhen tried to enter after them, the little maid cried \"Shoo!\" and flapped\\r\\nher apron in Billina\\'s face.\\n\"Shoo, yourself!\" retorted the hen, drawing back in anger and ruffling\\r\\nup her feathers. \"Haven\\'t you any better manners than that?\"\\n\"Oh, do you talk?\" enquired the maid, evidently surprised.\\n\"Can\\'t you hear me?\" snapped Billina. \"Drop[Pg 88] that apron, and get out of\\r\\nthe doorway, so that I may enter with my friends!\"\\n\"The Princess won\\'t like it,\" said the maid, hesitating.\\n\"I don\\'t care whether she likes it or not,\" replied Billina, and\\r\\nfluttering her wings with a loud noise she flew straight at the maid\\'s\\r\\nface. The little servant at once ducked her head, and the hen reached\\r\\nDorothy\\'s side, in safety.\\n\"Very well,\" sighed the maid; \"if you are all ruined because of this\\r\\nobstinate hen, don\\'t blame me for it. It isn\\'t safe to annoy the\\r\\nPrincess Langwidere.\"\\n\"Tell her we are waiting, if you please,\" Dorothy requested, with\\r\\ndignity. \"Billina is my friend, and must go wherever I go.\"\\nWithout more words the maid led them to a richly furnished drawing-room,\\r\\nlighted with subdued rainbow tints that came in through beautiful\\r\\nstained-glass windows.\\n\"Remain here,\" she said. \"What names shall I give the Princess?\"\\n\"I am Dorothy Gale, of Kansas,\" replied the child; \"and this gentleman\\r\\nis a machine named Tiktok, and the yellow hen is my friend Billina.\"\\n\\n\\n\"THE PRINCESS WONT LIKE IT,\" SAID THE MAID\\n\\nThe little servant bowed and withdrew, going[Pg 90][Pg 89] through several passages\\r\\nand mounting two marble stairways before she came to the apartments\\r\\noccupied by her mistress.\\nPrincess Langwidere\\'s sitting-room was panelled with great mirrors,\\r\\nwhich reached from the ceiling to the floor; also the ceiling was\\r\\ncomposed of mirrors, and the floor was of polished silver that reflected\\r\\nevery object upon it. So when Langwidere sat in her easy chair and\\r\\nplayed soft melodies upon her mandolin, her form was mirrored hundreds\\r\\nof times, in walls and ceiling and floor, and whichever way the lady\\r\\nturned her head she could see and admire her own features. This she\\r\\nloved to do, and just as the maid entered she was saying to herself:\\n\"This head with the auburn hair and hazel eyes is quite attractive. I\\r\\nmust wear it more often than I have done of late, although it may not be\\r\\nthe best of my collection.\"\\n\"You have company, Your Highness,\" announced the maid, bowing low.\\n\"Who is it?\" asked Langwidere, yawning.\\n\"Dorothy Gale of Kansas, Mr. Tiktok and Billina,\" answered the maid.\\n\"What a queer lot of names!\" murmured the Princess, beginning to be a\\r\\nlittle interested. \"What are they like? Is Dorothy Gale of Kansas\\r\\npretty?\"[Pg 91]\\n\"She might be called so,\" the maid replied.\\n\"And is Mr. Tiktok attractive?\" continued the Princess.\\n\"That I cannot say, Your Highness. But he seems very bright. Will Your\\r\\nGracious Highness see them?\"\\n\"Oh, I may as well, Nanda. But I am tired admiring this head, and if my\\r\\nvisitor has any claim to beauty I must take care that she does not\\r\\nsurpass me. So I will go to my cabinet and change to No. 17, which I\\r\\nthink is my best appearance. Don\\'t you?\"\\n\"Your No. 17 is exceedingly beautiful,\" answered Nanda, with another\\r\\nbow.\\nAgain the Princess yawned. Then she said:\\n\"Help me to rise.\"\\nSo the maid assisted her to gain her feet, although Langwidere was the\\r\\nstronger of the two; and then the Princess slowly walked across the\\r\\nsilver floor to her cabinet, leaning heavily at every step upon Nanda\\'s\\r\\narm.\\nNow I must explain to you that the Princess Langwidere had thirty\\r\\nheads—as many as there are days in the month. But of course she could\\r\\nonly wear one of them at a time, because she had but one neck. These\\r\\nheads were kept in what she called her \"cabinet,\" which was a beautiful\\r\\ndressing-room[Pg 92] that lay just between Langwidere\\'s sleeping-chamber and\\r\\nthe mirrored sitting-room. Each head was in a separate cupboard lined\\r\\nwith velvet. The cupboards ran all around the sides of the\\r\\ndressing-room, and had elaborately carved doors with gold numbers on the\\r\\noutside and jewelled-framed mirrors on the inside of them.\\nWhen the Princess got out of her crystal bed in the morning she went to\\r\\nher cabinet, opened one of the velvet-lined cupboards, and took the head\\r\\nit contained from its golden shelf. Then, by the aid of the mirror\\r\\ninside the open door, she put on the head—as neat and straight as could\\r\\nbe—and afterward called her maids to robe her for the day. She always\\r\\nwore a simple white costume, that suited all the heads. For, being able\\r\\nto change her face whenever she liked, the Princess had no interest in\\r\\nwearing a variety of gowns, as have other ladies who are compelled to\\r\\nwear the same face constantly.\\n\\n\\nBY THE AID OF THE MIRROR SHE PUT ON THE HEAD\\n\\nOf course the thirty heads were in great variety, no two formed alike\\r\\nbut all being of exceeding loveliness. There were heads with golden\\r\\nhair, brown hair, rich auburn hair and black hair; but none with gray\\r\\nhair. The heads had eyes of blue, of gray, of hazel, of brown and of\\r\\nblack; but there were no red eyes among them, and all were bright[Pg 94][Pg 93] and\\r\\nhandsome. The noses were Grecian, Roman, retroussé and Oriental,\\r\\nrepresenting all types of beauty; and the mouths were of assorted sizes\\r\\nand shapes, displaying pearly teeth when the heads smiled. As for\\r\\ndimples, they appeared in cheeks and chins, wherever they might be most\\r\\ncharming, and one or two heads had freckles upon the faces to contrast\\r\\nthe better with the brilliancy of their complexions.\\nOne key unlocked all the velvet cupboards containing these treasures—a\\r\\ncurious key carved from a single blood-red ruby—and this was fastened\\r\\nto a strong but slender chain which the Princess wore around her left\\r\\nwrist.\\nWhen Nanda had supported Langwidere to a position in front of cupboard\\r\\nNo. 17, the Princess unlocked the door with her ruby key and after\\r\\nhanding head No. 9, which she had been wearing, to the maid, she took\\r\\nNo. 17 from its shelf and fitted it to her neck. It had black hair and\\r\\ndark eyes and a lovely pearl-and-white complexion, and when Langwidere\\r\\nwore it she knew she was remarkably beautiful in appearance.\\nThere was only one trouble with No. 17; the temper that went with it\\r\\n(and which was hidden somewhere under the glossy black hair) was fiery,\\r\\nharsh and haughty in the extreme, and it often led[Pg 95] the Princess to do\\r\\nunpleasant things which she regretted when she came to wear her other\\r\\nheads.\\nBut she did not remember this today, and went to meet her guests in the\\r\\ndrawing-room with a feeling of certainty that she would surprise them\\r\\nwith her beauty.\\nHowever, she was greatly disappointed to find that her visitors were\\r\\nmerely a small girl in a gingham dress, a copper man that would only go\\r\\nwhen wound up, and a yellow hen that was sitting contentedly in\\r\\nLangwidere\\'s best work-basket, where there was a china egg used for\\r\\ndarning stockings.[A]\\n[A] It may surprise you to learn that a princess ever does such\\r\\na common thing as darn stockings. But, if you will stop to think, you\\r\\nwill realize that a princess is sure to wear holes in her stockings, the\\r\\nsame as other people; only it isn\\'t considered quite polite to mention\\r\\nthe matter.\\n\"Oh!\" said Langwidere, slightly lifting the nose of No. 17. \"I thought\\r\\nsome one of importance had called.\"\\n\"Then you were right,\" declared Dorothy. \"I\\'m a good deal of \\'portance\\r\\nmyself, and when Billina lays an egg she has the proudest cackle you\\r\\never heard. As for Tiktok, he\\'s the——\"\\n\"Stop—Stop!\" commanded the Princess, with an angry flash of her\\r\\nsplendid eyes. \"How dare you annoy me with your senseless chatter?\"[Pg 96]\\n\"Why, you horrid thing!\" said Dorothy, who was not accustomed to being\\r\\ntreated so rudely.\\nThe Princess looked at her more closely.\\n\"Tell me,\" she resumed, \"are you of royal blood?\"\\n\"Better than that, ma\\'am,\" said Dorothy. \"I came from Kansas.\"\\n\"Huh!\" cried the Princess, scornfully. \"You are a foolish child, and I\\r\\ncannot allow you to annoy me. Run away, you little goose, and bother\\r\\nsome one else.\"\\nDorothy was so indignant that for a moment she could find no words to\\r\\nreply. But she rose from her chair, and was about to leave the room when\\r\\nthe Princess, who had been scanning the girl\\'s face, stopped her by\\r\\nsaying, more gently:\\n\"Come nearer to me.\"\\nDorothy obeyed, without a thought of fear, and stood before the Princess\\r\\nwhile Langwidere examined her face with careful attention.\\n\"You are rather attractive,\" said the lady, presently. \"Not at all\\r\\nbeautiful, you understand, but you have a certain style of prettiness\\r\\nthat is different from that of any of my thirty heads. So I believe I\\'ll\\r\\ntake your head and give you No. 26 for it.\"\\n\"Well, I b\\'lieve you won\\'t!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\\n\\n\"WELL I B\\'LIEVE YOU WONT!\" EXCLAIMED DOROTHY\\n\\n\"It will do you no good to refuse,\" continued the[Pg 98][Pg 97] Princess; \"for I\\r\\nneed your head for my collection, and in the Land of Ev my will is law.\\r\\nI never have cared much for No. 26, and you will find that it is very\\r\\nlittle worn. Besides, it will do you just as well as the one you\\'re\\r\\nwearing, for all practical purposes.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about your No. 26, and I don\\'t want to,\" said\\r\\nDorothy, firmly. \"I\\'m not used to taking cast-off things, so I\\'ll just\\r\\nkeep my own head.\"\\n\"You refuse?\" cried the Princess, with a frown.\\n\"Of course I do,\" was the reply.\\n\"Then,\" said Langwidere, \"I shall lock you up in a tower until you\\r\\ndecide to obey me. Nanda,\" turning to her maid, \"call my army.\"\\nNanda rang a silver bell, and at once a big fat colonel in a bright red\\r\\nuniform entered the room, followed by ten lean soldiers, who all looked\\r\\nsad and discouraged and saluted the princess in a very melancholy\\r\\nfashion.\\n\"Carry that girl to the North Tower and lock her up!\" cried the\\r\\nPrincess, pointing to Dorothy.\\n\"To hear is to obey,\" answered the big red colonel, and caught the child\\r\\nby her arm. But at that moment Tiktok raised his dinner-pail and pounded\\r\\nit so forcibly against the colonel\\'s head that the big officer sat down\\r\\nupon the floor with a sudden bump,[Pg 99] looking both dazed and very much\\r\\nastonished.\\n\"Help!\" he shouted, and the ten lean soldiers sprang to assist their\\r\\nleader.\\nThere was great excitement for the next few moments, and Tiktok had\\r\\nknocked down seven of the army, who were sprawling in every direction\\r\\nupon the carpet, when suddenly the machine paused, with the dinner-pail\\r\\nraised for another blow, and remained perfectly motionless.\\n\"My ac-tion has run down,\" he called to Dorothy. \"Wind me up, quick.\"\\nShe tried to obey, but the big colonel had by this time managed to get\\r\\nupon his feet again, so he grabbed fast hold of the girl and she was\\r\\nhelpless to escape.\\n\"This is too bad,\" said the machine. \"I ought to have run six hours\\r\\nlon-ger, at least, but I sup-pose my long walk and my fight with the\\r\\nWheel-ers made me run down fast-er than us-u-al.\"\\n\"Well, it can\\'t be helped,\" said Dorothy, with a sigh.\\n\"Will you exchange heads with me?\" demanded the Princess.\\n\"No, indeed!\" cried Dorothy.\\n\"Then lock her up,\" said Langwidere to her soldiers, and they led\\r\\nDorothy to a high tower at the north of the palace and locked her\\r\\nsecurely within.[Pg 100] The soldiers afterward tried to lift Tiktok, but they\\r\\nfound the machine so solid and heavy that they could not stir it. So\\r\\nthey left him standing in the center of the drawing-room.\\n\"People will think I have a new statue,\" said Langwidere, \"so it won\\'t\\r\\nmatter in the least, and Nanda can keep him well polished.\"\\n\"What shall we do with the hen?\" asked the colonel, who had just\\r\\ndiscovered Billina in the work-basket.\\n\"Put her in the chicken-house,\" answered the Princess. \"Some day I\\'ll\\r\\nhave her fried for breakfast.\"\\n\"She looks rather tough, Your Highness,\" said Nanda, doubtfully.\\n\"That is a base slander!\" cried Billina, struggling frantically in the\\r\\ncolonel\\'s arms. \"But the breed of chickens I come from is said to be\\r\\npoison to all princesses.\"\\n\"Then,\" remarked Langwidere, \"I will not fry the hen, but keep her to\\r\\nlay eggs; and if she doesn\\'t do her duty I\\'ll have her drowned in the\\r\\nhorse trough.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 101]\\n\\nOzma of Oz to the Rescue\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nNanda brought Dorothy bread and water for her supper and she slept upon\\r\\na hard stone couch with a single pillow and a silken coverlet.\\nIn the morning she leaned out of the window of her prison in the tower\\r\\nto see if there was any way to escape. The room was not so very high up,\\r\\nwhen compared with our modern buildings, but it was far enough above the\\r\\ntrees and farm houses to give her a good view of the surrounding\\r\\ncountry.\\nTo the east she saw the forest, with the sands beyond it and the ocean\\r\\nbeyond that. There was even a dark speck upon the shore that she[Pg 102]\\r\\nthought might be the chicken-coop in which she had arrived at this\\r\\nsingular country.\\nThen she looked to the north, and saw a deep but narrow valley lying\\r\\nbetween two rocky mountains, and a third mountain that shut off the\\r\\nvalley at the further end.\\nWestward the fertile Land of Ev suddenly ended a little way from the\\r\\npalace, and the girl could see miles and miles of sandy desert that\\r\\nstretched further than her eyes could reach. It was this desert, she\\r\\nthought, with much interest, that alone separated her from the wonderful\\r\\nLand of Oz, and she remembered sorrowfully that she had been told no one\\r\\nhad ever been able to cross this dangerous waste but herself. Once a\\r\\ncyclone had carried her across it, and a magical pair of silver shoes\\r\\nhad carried her back again. But now she had neither a cyclone nor silver\\r\\nshoes to assist her, and her condition was sad indeed. For she had\\r\\nbecome the prisoner of a disagreeable princess who insisted that she\\r\\nmust exchange her head for another one that she was not used to, and\\r\\nwhich might not fit her at all.\\nReally, there seemed no hope of help for her from her old friends in the\\r\\nLand of Oz. Thoughtfully she gazed from her narrow window. On all the\\r\\ndesert not a living thing was stirring.[Pg 103]\\nWait, though! Something surely was stirring on the desert—something\\r\\nher eyes had not observed at first. Now it seemed like a cloud; now it\\r\\nseemed like a spot of silver; now it seemed to be a mass of rainbow\\r\\ncolors that moved swiftly toward her.\\n\\nWhat could it be, she wondered?\\nThen, gradually, but in a brief space of time nevertheless, the vision\\r\\ndrew near enough to Dorothy to make out what it was.\\nA broad green carpet was unrolling itself upon the desert, while\\r\\nadvancing across the carpet was a wonderful procession that made the\\r\\ngirl open her eyes in amazement as she gazed.\\nFirst came a magnificent golden chariot, drawn by a great Lion and an\\r\\nimmense Tiger, who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted along as\\r\\ngracefully as a well-matched team of thoroughbred horses. And standing\\r\\nupright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in flowing robes\\r\\nof silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her dainty head. She\\r\\nheld in one hand the satin ribbons that guided her astonishing team, and\\r\\nin the other an ivory wand that separated at the top into two prongs,\\r\\nthe prongs being tipped by the letters \"O\" and \"Z\", made of glistening\\r\\ndiamonds set closely together.\\nThe girl seemed neither older nor larger than[Pg 104] Dorothy herself, and at\\r\\nonce the prisoner in the tower guessed, that the lovely driver of the\\r\\nchariot must be that Ozma of Oz of whom she had so lately heard from\\r\\nTiktok.\\nFollowing close behind the chariot Dorothy saw her old friend the\\r\\nScarecrow, riding calmly astride a wooden Saw-Horse, which pranced and\\r\\ntrotted as naturally as any meat horse could have done.\\nAnd then came Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman, with his funnel-shaped cap\\r\\ntipped carelessly over his left ear, his gleaming axe over his right\\r\\nshoulder, and his whole body sparkling as brightly as it had ever done\\r\\nin the old days when first she knew him.\\nThe Tin Woodman was on foot, marching at the head of a company of\\r\\ntwenty-seven soldiers, of whom some were lean and some fat, some short\\r\\nand some tall; but all the twenty-seven were dressed in handsome\\r\\nuniforms of various designs and colors, no two being alike in any\\r\\nrespect.\\nBehind the soldiers the green carpet rolled itself up again, so that\\r\\nthere was always just enough of it for the procession to walk upon, in\\r\\norder that their feet might not come in contact with the deadly,\\r\\nlife-destroying sands of the desert.\\n\\n\\nTHE MAGIC CARPET\\n\\nDorothy knew at once it was a magic carpet she[Pg 106][Pg 105] beheld, and her heart\\r\\nbeat high with hope and joy as she realized she was soon to be rescued\\r\\nand allowed to greet her dearly beloved friends of Oz—the Scarecrow,\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.\\nIndeed, the girl felt herself as good as rescued as soon as she\\r\\nrecognized those in the procession, for she well knew the courage and\\r\\nloyalty of her old comrades, and also believed that any others who came\\r\\nfrom their marvelous country would prove to be pleasant and reliable\\r\\nacquaintances.\\nAs soon as the last bit of desert was passed and all the procession,\\r\\nfrom the beautiful and dainty Ozma to the last soldier, had reached the\\r\\ngrassy meadows of the Land of Ev, the magic carpet rolled itself\\r\\ntogether and entirely disappeared.\\nThen the chariot driver turned her Lion and Tiger into a broad roadway\\r\\nleading up to the palace, and the others followed, while Dorothy still\\r\\ngazed from her tower window in eager excitement.\\nThey came quite close to the front door of the palace and then halted,\\r\\nthe Scarecrow dismounting from his Saw-Horse to approach the sign\\r\\nfastened to the door, that he might read what it said.\\nDorothy, just above him, could keep silent no longer.[Pg 107]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Here I am!\" she shouted, as loudly as she could. \"Here\\'s Dorothy!\"\\n\"Dorothy who?\" asked the Scarecrow, tipping his head to look upward\\r\\nuntil he nearly lost his balance and tumbled over backward.\\n\"Dorothy Gale, of course. Your friend from Kansas,\" she answered.\\n\"Why, hello, Dorothy!\" said the Scarecrow. \"What in the world are you\\r\\ndoing up there?\"[Pg 108]\\n\"Nothing,\" she called down, \"because there\\'s nothing to do. Save me, my\\r\\nfriend—save me!\"\\n\"You seem to be quite safe now,\" replied the Scarecrow.\\n\"But I\\'m a prisoner. I\\'m locked in, so that I can\\'t get out,\" she\\r\\npleaded.\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You might be worse off, little\\r\\nDorothy. Just consider the matter. You can\\'t get drowned, or be run over\\r\\nby a Wheeler, or fall out of an apple-tree. Some folks would think they\\r\\nwere lucky to be up there.\"\\n\"Well, I don\\'t,\" declared the girl, \"and I want to get down immed\\'i\\'tly\\r\\nand see you and the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said the Scarecrow, nodding. \"It shall be just as you say,\\r\\nlittle friend. Who locked you up?\"\\n\"The princess Langwidere, who is a horrid creature,\" she answered.\\nAt this Ozma, who had been listening carefully to the conversation,\\r\\ncalled to Dorothy from her chariot, asking:\\n\"Why did the Princess lock you up, my dear?\"\\n\"Because,\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"I wouldn\\'t let her have my head for her\\r\\ncollection, and take an old, cast-off head in exchange for it.\"[Pg 109]\\n\\n\\n\"SAVE ME, MY FRIEND—SAVE ME!\"\\n[Pg 110]\\n\"I do not blame you,\" exclaimed Ozma, promptly. \"I will see the Princess\\r\\nat once, and oblige her to liberate you.\"\\n\"Oh, thank you very, very much!\" cried Dorothy, who as soon as she heard\\r\\nthe sweet voice of the girlish Ruler of Oz knew that she would soon\\r\\nlearn to love her dearly.\\nOzma now drove her chariot around to the third door of the wing, upon\\r\\nwhich the Tin Woodman boldly proceeded to knock.\\nAs soon as the maid opened the door Ozma, bearing in her hand her ivory\\r\\nwand, stepped into the hall and made her way at once to the\\r\\ndrawing-room, followed by all her company, except the Lion, and the\\r\\nTiger. And the twenty-seven soldiers made such a noise and a clatter\\r\\nthat the little maid Nanda ran away screaming to her mistress, whereupon\\r\\nthe Princess Langwidere, roused to great anger by this rude invasion of\\r\\nher palace, came running into the drawing room without any assistance\\r\\nwhatever.\\nThere she stood before the slight and delicate form of the little girl\\r\\nfrom Oz and cried out;—\\n\"How dare you enter my palace unbidden? Leave this room at once, or I\\r\\nwill bind you and all your people in chains, and throw you into my\\r\\ndarkest dungeons!\"[Pg 111]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"What a dangerous lady!\" murmured the Scarecrow, in a soft voice.\\n\"She seems a little nervous,\" replied the Tin Woodman.\\nBut Ozma only smiled at the angry Princess.\\n\"Sit down, please,\" she said, quietly. \"I have traveled a long way to\\r\\nsee you, and you must listen to what I have to say.\"\\n\"Must!\" screamed the Princess, her black eyes flashing with fury—for\\r\\nshe still wore her No. 17 head. \"Must, to me!\"[Pg 112]\\n\"To be sure,\" said Ozma. \"I am Ruler of the Land of Oz, and I am\\r\\npowerful enough to destroy all your kingdom, if I so wish. Yet I did not\\r\\ncome here to do harm, but rather to free the royal family of Ev from the\\r\\nthrall of the Noma King, the news having reached me that he is holding\\r\\nthe Queen and her children prisoners.\"\\nHearing these words, Langwidere suddenly became quiet.\\n\"I wish you could, indeed, free my aunt and her ten royal children,\"\\r\\nsaid she, eagerly. \"For if they were restored to their proper forms and\\r\\nstation they could rule the Kingdom of Ev themselves, and that would\\r\\nsave me a lot of worry and trouble. At present there are at least ten\\r\\nminutes every day that I must devote to affairs of state, and I would\\r\\nlike to be able to spend my whole time in admiring my beautiful heads.\"\\n\"Then we will presently discuss this matter,\" said Ozma, \"and try to\\r\\nfind a way to liberate your aunt and cousins. But first you must\\r\\nliberate another prisoner—the little girl you have locked up in your\\r\\ntower.\"\\n\\n\\n\"WHAT A DANGEROUS LADY!\" MURMURED THE SCARECROW\\n\\n\"Of course,\" said Langwidere, readily. \"I had forgotten all about her.\\r\\nThat was yesterday, you know, and a Princess cannot be expected to[Pg 114][Pg 113]\\r\\nremember today what she did yesterday. Come with me, and I will release\\r\\nthe prisoner at once.\"\\nSo Ozma followed her, and they passed up the stairs that led to the room\\r\\nin the tower.\\nWhile they were gone Ozma\\'s followers remained in the drawing-room, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow was leaning against a form that he had mistaken for a\\r\\ncopper statue when a harsh, metallic voice said suddenly in his ear:\\n\"Get off my foot, please. You are scratch-ing my pol-ish.\"\\n\"Oh, excuse me!\" he replied, hastily drawing back. \"Are you alive?\"\\n\"No,\" said Tiktok, \"I am on-ly a ma-chine. But I can think and speak and\\r\\nact, when I am pro-per-ly wound up. Just now my ac-tion is run down, and\\r\\nDor-o-thy has the key to it.\"\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"Dorothy will soon be free,\\r\\nand then she\\'ll attend to your works. But it must be a great misfortune\\r\\nnot to be alive. I\\'m sorry for you.\"\\n\"Why?\" asked Tiktok.\\n\"Because you have no brains, as I have,\" said the Scarecrow.\\n\"Oh, yes, I have,\" returned Tiktok. \"I am fit-ted with Smith & Tin-ker\\'s\\r\\nImproved Com-bi-[Pg 115]na-tion Steel Brains. They are what make me think. What\\r\\nsort of brains are you fit-ted with?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" admitted the Scarecrow. \"They were given to me by the\\r\\ngreat Wizard of Oz, and I didn\\'t get a chance to examine them before he\\r\\nput them in. But they work splendidly and my conscience is very active.\\r\\nHave you a conscience?\"\\n\"No,\" said Tiktok.\\n\"And no heart, I suppose?\" added the Tin Woodman, who had been listening\\r\\nwith interest to this conversation.\\n\"No,\" said Tiktok.\\n\"Then,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"I regret to say that you are greatly\\r\\ninferior to my friend the Scarecrow, and to myself. For we are both\\r\\nalive, and he has brains which do not need to be wound up, while I have\\r\\nan excellent heart that is continually beating in my bosom.\"\\n\"I con-grat-u-late you,\" replied Tiktok. \"I can-not help be-ing your\\r\\nin-fer-i-or for I am a mere ma-chine. When I am wound up I do my du-ty\\r\\nby go-ing just as my ma-chin-er-y is made to go. You have no i-de-a how\\r\\nfull of ma-chin-er-y I am.\"\\n\"I can guess,\" said the Scarecrow, looking at the machine man curiously.\\r\\n\"Some day I\\'d like[Pg 116] to take you apart and see just how you are made.\"\\n\"Do not do that, I beg of you,\" said Tiktok; \"for you could not put me\\r\\nto-geth-er a-gain, and my use-ful-ness would be de-stroyed.\"\\n\"Oh! are you useful?\" asked the Scarecrow, surprised.\\n\"Ve-ry,\" said Tiktok.\\n\"In that case,\" the Scarecrow kindly promised, \"I won\\'t fool with your\\r\\ninterior at all. For I am a poor mechanic, and might mix you up.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" said Tiktok.\\nJust then Ozma re-entered the room, leading Dorothy by the hand and\\r\\nfollowed closely by the Princess Langwidere.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 117]\\n\\nThe Hungry Tiger\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe first thing Dorothy did was to rush into the embrace of the\\r\\nScarecrow, whose painted face beamed with delight as he pressed her form\\r\\nto his straw-padded bosom. Then the Tin Woodman embraced her—very\\r\\ngently, for he knew his tin arms might hurt her if he squeezed too\\r\\nroughly.\\nThese greetings having been exchanged, Dorothy took the key to Tiktok\\r\\nfrom her pocket and wound up the machine man\\'s action, so that he could\\r\\nbow properly when introduced to the rest of the company.[Pg 118] While doing\\r\\nthis she told them now useful Tiktok had been to her, and both the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman shook hands with the machine once more and\\r\\nthanked him for protecting their friend.\\nThen Dorothy asked: \"Where is Billina?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Who is Billina?\"\\n\"She\\'s a yellow hen who is another friend of mine,\" answered the girl,\\r\\nanxiously. \"I wonder what has become of her?\"\\n\"She is in the chicken house, in the back yard,\" said the Princess. \"My\\r\\ndrawing-room is no place for hens.\"\\nWithout waiting to hear more Dorothy ran to get Billina, and just\\r\\noutside the door she came upon the Cowardly Lion, still hitched to the\\r\\nchariot beside the great Tiger. The Cowardly Lion had a big bow of blue\\r\\nribbon fastened to the long hair between his ears, and the Tiger wore a\\r\\nbow of red ribbon on his tail, just in front of the bushy end.\\nIn an instant Dorothy was hugging the huge Lion joyfully.\\n\"I\\'m so glad to see you again!\" she cried.\\n\"I am also glad to see you, Dorothy,\" said the Lion. \"We\\'ve had some\\r\\nfine adventures together, haven\\'t we?\"[Pg 119]\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" she replied. \"How are you?\"\\n\\n\"As cowardly as ever,\" the beast answered in a meek voice. \"Every little\\r\\nthing scares me and makes my heart beat fast. But let me introduce to\\r\\nyou a new friend of mine, the Hungry Tiger.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh! Are you hungry?\" she asked, turning to the other beast, who was\\r\\njust then yawning so widely that he displayed two rows of terrible teeth\\r\\nand a mouth big enough to startle anyone.\\n\"Dreadfully hungry,\" answered the Tiger, snapping his jaws together with\\r\\na fierce click.\\n\"Then why don\\'t you eat something?\" she asked.[Pg 120]\\n\"It\\'s no use,\" said the Tiger sadly. \"I\\'ve tried that, but I always get\\r\\nhungry again.\"\\n\"Why, it is the same with me,\" said Dorothy. \"Yet I keep on eating.\"\\n\"But you eat harmless things, so it doesn\\'t matter,\" replied the Tiger.\\r\\n\"For my part, I\\'m a savage beast, and have an appetite for all sorts of\\r\\npoor little living creatures, from a chipmonk to fat babies.\\n\"How dreadful!\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Isn\\'t it, though?\" returned the Hungry Tiger, licking his lips with his\\r\\nlong red tongue. \"Fat babies! Don\\'t they sound delicious? But I\\'ve never\\r\\neaten any, because my conscience tells me it is wrong. If I had no\\r\\nconscience I would probably eat the babies and then get hungry again,\\r\\nwhich would mean that I had sacrificed the poor babies for nothing. No;\\r\\nhungry I was born, and hungry I shall die. But I\\'ll not have any cruel\\r\\ndeeds on my conscience to be sorry for.\"\\n\"I think you are a very good tiger,\" said Dorothy, patting the huge head\\r\\nof the beast.\\n\"In that you are mistaken,\" was the reply. \"I am a good beast, perhaps,\\r\\nbut a disgracefully bad tiger. For it is the nature of tigers to be\\r\\ncruel and ferocious, and in refusing to eat harmless living creatures I\\r\\nam acting as no good tiger has ever[Pg 122][Pg 121] before acted. That is why I left\\r\\nthe forest and joined my friend the Cowardly Lion.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE HUNGRY TIGER\\n\\n\"But the Lion is not really cowardly,\" said Dorothy. \"I have seen him\\r\\nact as bravely as can be.\"\\n\"All a mistake, my dear,\" protested the Lion gravely. \"To others I may\\r\\nhave seemed brave, at times, but I have never been in any danger that I\\r\\nwas not afraid.\"\\n\"Nor I,\" said Dorothy, truthfully. \"But I must go and set free Billina,\\r\\nand then I will see you again.\"\\nShe ran around to the back yard of the palace and soon found the chicken\\r\\nhouse, being guided to it by a loud cackling and crowing and a\\r\\ndistracting hubbub of sounds such as chickens make when they are\\r\\nexcited.\\nSomething seemed to be wrong in the chicken house, and when Dorothy\\r\\nlooked through the slats in the door she saw a group of hens and\\r\\nroosters huddled in one corner and watching what appeared to be a\\r\\nwhirling ball of feathers. It bounded here and there about the chicken\\r\\nhouse, and at first Dorothy could not tell what it was, while the\\r\\nscreeching of the chickens nearly deafened her.\\nBut suddenly the bunch of feathers stopped whirling, and then, to her\\r\\namazement, the girl saw[Pg 123] Billina crouching upon the prostrate form of a\\r\\nspeckled rooster. For an instant they both remained motionless, and then\\r\\nthe yellow hen shook her wings to settle the feathers and walked toward\\r\\nthe door with a strut of proud defiance and a cluck of victory, while\\r\\nthe speckled rooster limped away to the group of other chickens,\\r\\ntrailing his crumpled plumage in the dust as he went.\\n\"Why, Billina!\" cried Dorothy, in a shocked voice; \"have you been\\r\\nfighting?\"\\n\"I really think I have,\" retorted Billina. \"Do you think I\\'d let that\\r\\nspeckled villain of a rooster lord it over me, and claim to run this\\r\\nchicken house, as long as I\\'m able to peck and scratch? Not if my name\\r\\nis Bill!\"\\n\"It isn\\'t Bill, it\\'s Billina; and you\\'re talking slang, which is very\\r\\nundig\\'n\\'fied,\" said Dorothy, reprovingly. \"Come here, Billina, and I\\'ll\\r\\nlet you out; for Ozma of Oz is here, and has set us free.\"\\nSo the yellow hen came to the door, which Dorothy unlatched for her to\\r\\npass through, and the other chickens silently watched them from their\\r\\ncorner without offering to approach nearer.\\nThe girl lifted her friend in her arms and exclaimed:\\n\"Oh, Billina! how dreadful you look. You\\'ve[Pg 124] lost a lot of feathers, and\\r\\none of your eyes is nearly pecked out, and your comb is bleeding!\"\\n\"That\\'s nothing,\" said Billina. \"Just look at the speckled rooster!\\r\\nDidn\\'t I do him up brown?\"\\nDorothy shook her head.\\n\"I don\\'t \\'prove of this, at all,\" she said, carrying Billina away toward\\r\\nthe palace. \"It isn\\'t a good thing for you to \\'sociate with those common\\r\\nchickens. They would soon spoil your good manners, and you wouldn\\'t be\\r\\nrespec\\'able any more.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t ask to associate with them,\" replied Billina. \"It is that\\r\\ncross old Princess who is to blame. But I was raised in the United\\r\\nStates, and I won\\'t allow any one-horse chicken of the Land of Ev to run\\r\\nover me and put on airs, as long as I can lift a claw in self-defense.\"\\n\"Very well, Billina,\" said Dorothy. \"We won\\'t talk about it any more.\"\\nSoon they came to the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger to whom the\\r\\ngirl introduced the Yellow Hen.\\n\"Glad to meet any friend of Dorothy\\'s,\" said the Lion, politely. \"To\\r\\njudge by your present appearance, you are not a coward, as I am.\"\\n\\n\\n\"WHY, BILLINA!\" CRIED DOROTHY; \"HAVE YOU BEEN FIGHTING?\"\\n\\n\"Your present appearance makes my mouth water,\" said the Tiger, looking\\r\\nat Billina greedily.[Pg 126][Pg 125] \"My, my! how good you would taste if I could only\\r\\ncrunch you between my jaws. But don\\'t worry. You would only appease my\\r\\nappetite for a moment; so it isn\\'t worth while to eat you.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" said the hen, nestling closer in Dorothy\\'s arms.\\n\"Besides, it wouldn\\'t be right,\" continued the Tiger, looking steadily\\r\\nat Billina and clicking his jaws together.\\n\"Of course not,\" cried Dorothy, hastily. \"Billina is my friend, and you\\r\\nmustn\\'t ever eat her under any circ\\'mstances.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try to remember that,\" said the Tiger; \"but I\\'m a little\\r\\nabsent-minded, at times.\"\\nThen Dorothy carried her pet into the drawing-room of the palace, where\\r\\nTiktok, being invited to do so by Ozma, had seated himself between the\\r\\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Opposite to them sat Ozma herself and the\\r\\nPrincess Langwidere, and beside them there was a vacant chair for\\r\\nDorothy.\\nAround this important group was ranged the Army of Oz, and as Dorothy\\r\\nlooked at the handsome uniforms of the Twenty-Seven she said:\\n\"Why, they seem to be all officers.\"\\n\"They are, all except one,\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"I have in my Army\\r\\neight Generals,[Pg 127] six Colonels, seven Majors and five Captains, besides\\r\\none private for them to command. I\\'d like to promote the private, for I\\r\\nbelieve no private should ever be in public life; and I\\'ve also noticed\\r\\nthat officers usually fight better and are more reliable than common\\r\\nsoldiers. Besides, the officers are more important looking, and lend\\r\\ndignity to our army.\"\\n\"No doubt you are right,\" said Dorothy, seating herself beside Ozma.\\n\"And now,\" announced the girlish Ruler of Oz, \"we will hold a solemn\\r\\nconference to decide the best manner of liberating the royal family of\\r\\nthis fair Land of Ev from their long imprisonment.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 128]\\n\\nThe Royal Family of Ev\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe Tin Woodman was the first to address the meeting.\\n\"To begin with,\" said he, \"word came to our noble and illustrous Ruler,\\r\\nOzma of Oz, that the wife and ten children—five boys and five girls—of\\r\\nthe former King of Ev, by name Evoldo, have been enslaved by the Nome\\r\\nKing and are held prisoners in his underground palace. Also that there\\r\\nwas no one in Ev powerful enough to release them. Naturally our Ozma\\r\\nwished to undertake the adventure of liberating the poor prisoners; but\\r\\nfor a long time she could find no way to cross the great[Pg 129] desert between\\r\\nthe two countries. Finally she went to a friendly sorceress of our land\\r\\nnamed Glinda the Good, who heard the story and at once presented Ozma a\\r\\nmagic carpet, which would continually unroll beneath our feet and so\\r\\nmake a comfortable path for us to cross the desert. As soon as she had\\r\\nreceived the carpet our gracious Ruler ordered me to assemble our army,\\r\\nwhich I did. You behold in these bold warriors the pick of all the\\r\\nfinest soldiers of Oz; and, if we are obliged to fight the Nome King,\\r\\nevery officer as well as the private, will battle fiercely unto death.\"\\nThen Tiktok spoke.\\n\"Why should you fight the Nome King?\" he asked. \"He has done no wrong.\"\\n\"No wrong!\" cried Dorothy. \"Isn\\'t it wrong to imprison a queen mother\\r\\nand her ten children?\"\\n\"They were sold to the Nome King by King Ev-ol-do,\" replied Tiktok. \"It\\r\\nwas the King of Ev who did wrong, and when he re-al-ized what he had\\r\\ndone he jumped in-to the sea and drowned him-self.\"\\n\"This is news to me,\" said Ozma, thoughtfully. \"I had supposed the Nome\\r\\nKing was all to blame in the matter. But, in any case, he must be made\\r\\nto liberate the prisoners.\"\\n\"My uncle Evoldo was a very wicked man,\"[Pg 130] declared the Princess\\r\\nLangwidere. \"If he had drowned himself before he sold his family, no one\\r\\nwould have cared. But he sold them to the powerful Nome King in exchange\\r\\nfor a long life, and afterward destroyed the life by jumping into the\\r\\nsea.\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said Ozma, \"he did not get the long life, and the Nome King must\\r\\ngive up the prisoners. Where are they confined?\"\\n\"No one knows, exactly,\" replied the Princess. \"For the king, whose name\\r\\nis Roquat of the Rocks, owns a splendid palace underneath the great\\r\\nmountain which is at the north end of this kingdom, and he has\\r\\ntransformed the queen and her children into ornaments and bric-a-brac\\r\\nwith which to decorate his rooms.\"\\n\"I\\'d like to know,\" said Dorothy, \"who this Nome King is?\"\\n\"I will tell you,\" replied Ozma. \"He is said to be the Ruler of the\\r\\nUnderground World, and commands the rocks and all that the rocks\\r\\ncontain. Under his rule are many thousands of the Nomes, who are queerly\\r\\nshaped but powerful sprites that labor at the furnaces and forges of\\r\\ntheir king, making gold and silver and other metals which they conceal\\r\\nin the crevices of the rocks, so that those living upon[Pg 131] the earth\\'s\\r\\nsurface can only find them with great difficulty. Also they make\\r\\ndiamonds and rubies and emeralds, which they hide in the ground; so that\\r\\nthe kingdom of the Nomes is wonderfully rich, and all we have of\\r\\nprecious stones and silver and gold is what we take from the earth and\\r\\nrocks where the Nome King has hidden them.\"\\n\"I understand,\" said Dorothy, nodding her little head wisely.\\n\"For the reason that we often steal his treasures,\" continued Ozma, \"the\\r\\nRuler of the Underground World is not fond of those who live upon the\\r\\nearth\\'s surface, and never appears among us. If we wish to see King\\r\\nRoquat of the Rocks, we must visit his own country, where he is all\\r\\npowerful, and therefore it will be a dangerous undertaking.\"\\n\"But, for the sake of the poor prisoners,\" said Dorothy, \"we ought to do\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"We shall do it,\" replied the Scarecrow, \"although it requires a lot of\\r\\ncourage for me to go near to the furnaces of the Nome King. For I am\\r\\nonly stuffed with straw, and a single spark of fire might destroy me\\r\\nentirely.\"\\n\"The furnaces may also melt my tin,\" said the Tin Woodman; \"but I am\\r\\ngoing.\"\\n\"I can\\'t bear heat,\" remarked the Princess Lang[Pg 132]widere, yawning lazily,\\r\\n\"so I shall stay at home. But I wish you may have success in your\\r\\nundertaking, for I am heartily tired of ruling this stupid kingdom, and\\r\\nI need more leisure in which to admire my beautiful heads.\"\\n\"We do not need you,\" said Ozma. \"For, if with the aid of my brave\\r\\nfollowers I cannot accomplish my purpose, then it would be useless for\\r\\nyou to undertake the journey.\"\\n\"Quite true,\" sighed the Princess. \"So, if you\\'ll excuse me, I will now\\r\\nretire to my cabinet. I\\'ve worn this head quite awhile, and I want to\\r\\nchange it for another.\"\\nWhen she had left them (and you may be sure no one was sorry to see her\\r\\ngo) Ozma said to Tiktok:\\n\"Will you join our party?\"\\n\"I am the slave of the girl Dor-oth-y, who res-cued me from pris-on,\"\\r\\nreplied the machine. \"Where she goes I will go.\"\\n\"Oh, I am going with my friends, of course,\" said Dorothy, quickly. \"I\\r\\nwouldn\\'t miss the fun for anything. Will you go, too, Billina?\"\\n\"To be sure,\" said Billina in a careless tone. She was smoothing down\\r\\nthe feathers of her back and not paying much attention.[Pg 133]\\n\\n\\n\"I CAN\\'T BEAR HEAT,\" REMARKED LANGWIDERE\\n[Pg 134]\\n\"Heat is just in her line,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"If she is nicely\\r\\nroasted, she will be better than ever.\"\\n\"Then,\" said Ozma, \"we will arrange to start for the Kingdom of the Nomes\\r\\nat daybreak tomorrow. And, in the meantime, we will rest and prepare\\r\\nourselves for the journey.\"\\nAlthough Princess Langwidere did not again appear to her guests, the\\r\\npalace servants waited upon the strangers from Oz and did everything in\\r\\ntheir power to make the party comfortable. There were many vacant rooms\\r\\nat their disposal, and the brave Army of twenty-seven was easily\\r\\nprovided for and liberally feasted.\\nThe Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were unharnessed from the chariot\\r\\nand allowed to roam at will throughout the palace, where they nearly\\r\\nfrightened the servants into fits, although they did no harm at all. At\\r\\none time Dorothy found the little maid Nanda crouching in terror in a\\r\\ncorner, with the Hungry Tiger standing before her.\\n\"You certainly look delicious,\" the beast was saying. \"Will you kindly\\r\\ngive me permission to eat you?\"\\n\"No, no, no!\" cried the maid in reply.\\n\"Then,\" said the Tiger, yawning frightfully,[Pg 135] \"please to get me about\\r\\nthirty pounds of tenderloin steak, cooked rare, with a peck of boiled\\r\\npotatoes on the side, and five gallons of ice-cream for dessert.\"\\n\"I—I\\'ll do the best I can!\" said Nanda, and she ran away as fast as she\\r\\ncould go.\\n\"Are you so very hungry?\" asked Dorothy, in wonder.\\n\"You can hardly imagine the size of my appetite,\" replied the Tiger,\\r\\nsadly. \"It seems to fill my whole body, from the end of my throat to the\\r\\ntip of my tail. I am very sure the appetite doesn\\'t fit me, and is too\\r\\nlarge for the size of my body. Some day, when I meet a dentist with a\\r\\npair of forceps, I\\'m going to have it pulled.\"\\n\"What, your tooth?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"No, my appetite,\" said the Hungry Tiger.\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY RELATED TO THEM HER OWN ADVENTURES\\n\\nThe little girl spent most of the afternoon talking with the Scarecrow\\r\\nand the Tin Woodman, who related to her all that had taken place in the\\r\\nLand of Oz since Dorothy had left it. She was much interested in the\\r\\nstory of Ozma, who had been, when a baby, stolen by a wicked old witch\\r\\nand transformed into a boy. She did not know that she had ever been a\\r\\ngirl until she was restored to her natural form by a kind sorceress.\\r\\nThen it was found that she was the only child of[Pg 137][Pg 136] the former Ruler of\\r\\nOz, and was entitled to rule in his place. Ozma had many adventures,\\r\\nhowever, before she regained her father\\'s throne, and in these she was\\r\\naccompanied by a pumpkin-headed man, a highly magnified and thoroughly\\r\\neducated Woggle-Bug, and a wonderful sawhorse that had been brought to\\r\\nlife by means of a magic powder. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman had\\r\\nalso assisted her; but the Cowardly Lion, who ruled the great forest as\\r\\nthe King of Beasts, knew nothing of Ozma until after she became the\\r\\nreigning princess of Oz. Then he journeyed to the Emerald City to see\\r\\nher, and on hearing she was about to visit the Land of Ev to set free\\r\\nthe royal family of that country, the Cowardly Lion begged to go with\\r\\nher, and brought along his friend, the Hungry Tiger, as well.\\nHaving heard this story, Dorothy related to them her own adventures, and\\r\\nthen went out with her friends to find the Sawhorse, which Ozma had\\r\\ncaused to be shod with plates of gold, so that its legs would not wear\\r\\nout.\\nThey came upon the Sawhorse standing motionless beside the garden gate,\\r\\nbut when Dorothy was introduced to him he bowed politely and blinked his\\r\\neyes, which were knots of wood, and wagged his tail, which was only the\\r\\nbranch of a tree.[Pg 138]\\n\"What a remarkable thing, to be alive!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\"I quite agree with you,\" replied the Sawhorse, in a rough but not\\r\\nunpleasant voice. \"A creature like me has no business to live, as we all\\r\\nknow. But it was the magic powder that did it, so I cannot justly be\\r\\nblamed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"And you seem to be of some use, \\'cause I\\r\\nnoticed the Scarecrow riding upon your back.\"\\n\"Oh, yes; I\\'m of use,\" returned the Sawhorse;[Pg 139] \"and I never tire, never\\r\\nhave to be fed, or cared for in any way.\"\\n\"Are you intel\\'gent?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Not very,\" said the creature. \"It would be foolish to waste intelligence\\r\\non a common Sawhorse, when so many professors need it. But I know enough\\r\\nto obey my masters, and to gid-dup, or whoa, when I\\'m told to. So I\\'m\\r\\npretty well satisfied.\"\\nThat night Dorothy slept in a pleasant little bedchamber next to that\\r\\noccupied by Ozma of Oz, and Billina perched upon the foot of the bed and\\r\\ntucked her head under her wing and slept as soundly in that position as\\r\\ndid Dorothy upon her soft cushions.\\nBut before daybreak every one was awake and stirring, and soon the\\r\\nadventurers were eating a hasty breakfast in the great dining-room of\\r\\nthe palace. Ozma sat at the head of a long table, on a raised platform,\\r\\nwith Dorothy on her right hand and the Scarecrow on her left. The\\r\\nScarecrow did not eat, of course; but Ozma placed him near her so that\\r\\nshe might ask his advice about the journey while she ate.\\nLower down the table were the twenty-seven warriors of Oz, and at the\\r\\nend of the room the Lion and the Tiger were eating out of a kettle that\\r\\nhad[Pg 140] been placed upon the floor, while Billina fluttered around to pick\\r\\nup any scraps that might be scattered.\\nIt did not take long to finish the meal, and then the Lion and the Tiger\\r\\nwere harnessed to the chariot and the party was ready to start for the\\r\\nNome King\\'s Palace.\\nFirst rode Ozma, with Dorothy beside her in the golden chariot and\\r\\nholding Billina fast in her arms. Then came the Scarecrow on the\\r\\nSawhorse, with the Tin Woodman and Tiktok marching side by side just\\r\\nbehind him. After these tramped the Army, looking brave and handsome in\\r\\ntheir splendid uniforms. The generals commanded the colonels and the\\r\\ncolonels commanded the majors and the majors commanded the captains and\\r\\nthe captains commanded the private, who marched with an air of proud\\r\\nimportance because it required so many officers to give him his orders.\\nAnd so the magnificent procession left the palace and started along the\\r\\nroad just as day was breaking, and by the time the sun came out they had\\r\\nmade good progress toward the valley that led to the Nome King\\'s\\r\\ndomain.[Pg 141]\\n\\nThe Giant with the Hammer\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nThe road led for a time through a pretty farm country, and then past a\\r\\npicnic grove that was very inviting. But the procession continued to\\r\\nsteadily advance until Billina cried in an abrupt and commanding manner:\\n\"Wait—wait!\"\\nOzma stopped her chariot so suddenly that the Scarecrow\\'s Sawhorse\\r\\nnearly ran into it, and the ranks of the army tumbled over one another\\r\\nbefore they could come to a halt. Immediately the yellow hen struggled\\r\\nfrom Dorothy\\'s arms and flew into a clump of bushes by the roadside.[Pg 142]\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" called the Tin Woodman, anxiously.\\n\"Why, Billina wants to lay her egg, that\\'s all,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Lay her egg!\" repeated the Tin Woodman, in astonishment.\\n\"Yes; she lays one every morning, about this time; and it\\'s quite\\r\\nfresh,\" said the girl.\\n\"But does your foolish old hen suppose that this entire cavalcade, which\\r\\nis bound on an important adventure, is going to stand still while she\\r\\nlays her egg?\" enquired the Tin Woodman, earnestly.\\n\"What else can we do?\" asked the girl. \"It\\'s a habit of Billina\\'s and\\r\\nshe can\\'t break herself of it.\"\\n\"Then she must hurry up,\" said the Tin Woodman, impatiently.\\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed the Scarecrow. \"If she hurries she may lay scrambled\\r\\neggs.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s nonsense,\" said Dorothy. \"But Billina won\\'t be long, I\\'m sure.\"\\nSo they stood and waited, although all were restless and anxious to\\r\\nproceed. And by and by the yellow hen came from the bushes saying:\\n\"Kut-kut, kut, ka-daw-kutt!\" Kut, kut, kut—ka-daw-kut!\"[Pg 143] \"What is she\\r\\ndoing—singing her lay?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"For-ward—march!\" shouted the Tin Woodman, waving his axe, and the\\r\\nprocession started just as Dorothy had once more grabbed Billina in her\\r\\narms.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t anyone going to get my egg?\" cried the hen, in great excitement.\\n\"I\\'ll get it,\" said the Scarecrow; and at his command the Sawhorse\\r\\npranced into the bushes. The straw man soon found the egg, which he\\r\\nplaced in his jacket pocket. The cavalcade, having moved rapidly on, was\\r\\neven then far in advance; but it did[Pg 144] not take the Sawhorse long to\\r\\ncatch up with it, and presently the Scarecrow was riding in his\\r\\naccustomed place behind Ozma\\'s chariot.\\n\"What shall I do with the egg?\" he asked Dorothy.\\n\"I do not know,\" the girl answered. \"Perhaps the Hungry Tiger would like\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"It would not be enough to fill one of my back teeth,\" remarked the\\r\\nTiger. \"A bushel of them, hard boiled, might take a little of the edge\\r\\noff my appetite; but one egg isn\\'t good for anything at all, that I know\\r\\nof.\"[Pg 145]\\n\"No; it wouldn\\'t even make a sponge cake,\" said the Scarecrow,\\r\\nthoughtfully. \"The Tin Woodman might carry it with his axe and hatch it;\\r\\nbut after all I may as well keep it myself for a souvenir.\" So he left\\r\\nit in his pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\nThey had now reached that part of the valley that lay between the two\\r\\nhigh mountains which Dorothy had seen from her tower window. At the far\\r\\nend was the third great mountain, which blocked the valley and was the\\r\\nnorthern edge of the Land of Ev. It was underneath this mountain that\\r\\nthe Nome King\\'s palace was said to be; but it would[Pg 146] be some time before\\r\\nthey reached that place.\\nThe path was becoming rocky and difficult for the wheels of the chariot\\r\\nto pass over, and presently a deep gulf appeared at their feet which was\\r\\ntoo wide for them to leap. So Ozma took a small square of green cloth\\r\\nfrom her pocket and threw it upon the ground. At once it became the\\r\\nmagic carpet, and unrolled itself far enough for all the cavalcade to\\r\\nwalk upon. The chariot now advanced, and the green carpet unrolled\\r\\nbefore it, crossing the gulf on a level with its banks, so that all\\r\\npassed over in safety.\\n\"That\\'s easy enough,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I wonder what will happen\\r\\nnext.\"\\nHe was not long in making the discovery, for the sides of the mountain\\r\\ncame closer together until finally there was but a narrow path between\\r\\nthem, along which Ozma and her party were forced to pass in single file.\\nThey now heard a low and deep \"thump!—--thump!—--thump!\" which echoed\\r\\nthroughout the valley and seemed to grow louder as they advanced. Then,\\r\\nturning a corner of rock, they saw before them a huge form, which\\r\\ntowered above the path for more than a hundred feet. The form was that\\r\\nof a gigantic man built out of plates of cast iron,[Pg 147] and it stood with\\r\\none foot on either side of the narrow road and swung over its right\\r\\nshoulder an immense iron mallet, with which it constantly pounded the\\r\\nearth. These resounding blows explained the thumping sounds they had\\r\\nheard, for the mallet was much bigger than a barrel, and where it struck\\r\\nthe path between the rocky sides of the mountain it filled all the space\\r\\nthrough which our travelers would be obliged to pass.\\nOf course they at once halted, a safe distance away from the terrible\\r\\niron mallet. The magic carpet would do them no good in this case, for it\\r\\nwas only meant to protect them from any dangers upon the ground beneath\\r\\ntheir feet, and not from dangers that appeared in the air above them.\\n\"Wow!\" said the Cowardly Lion, with a shudder. \"It makes me dreadfully\\r\\nnervous to see that big hammer pounding so near my head. One blow would\\r\\ncrush me into a door-mat.\"\\n\"The ir-on gi-ant is a fine fel-low,\" said Tiktok, \"and works as\\r\\nstead-i-ly as a clock. He was made for the Nome King by Smith & Tin-ker,\\r\\nwho made me, and his du-ty is to keep folks from find-ing the\\r\\nun-der-ground pal-ace. Is he not a great work of art?\"\\n\"Can he think, and speak, as you do?\" asked[Pg 148] Ozma, regarding the giant\\r\\nwith wondering eyes.\\n\"No,\" replied the machine; \"he is on-ly made to pound the road, and has\\r\\nno think-ing or speak-ing at-tach-ment. But he pounds ve-ry well, I\\r\\nthink.\"\\n\"Too well,\" observed the Scarecrow. \"He is keeping us from going\\r\\nfarther. Is there no way to stop his machinery?\"\\n\"On-ly the Nome King, who has the key, can do that,\" answered Tiktok.\\n\"Then,\" said Dorothy, anxiously, \"what shall we do?\"\\n\"Excuse me for a few minutes,\" said the Scarecrow, \"and I will think it\\r\\nover.\"\\nHe retired, then, to a position in the rear, where he turned his painted\\r\\nface to the rocks and began to think.\\nMeantime the giant continued to raise his iron mallet high in the air\\r\\nand to strike the path terrific blows that echoed through the mountains\\r\\nlike the roar of a cannon. Each time the mallet lifted, however, there\\r\\nwas a moment when the path beneath the monster was free, and perhaps the\\r\\nScarecrow had noticed this, for when he came back to the others he said:\\n\"The matter is a very simple one, after all. We have but to run under\\r\\nthe hammer, one at a time,[Pg 150][Pg 149] when it is lifted, and pass to the other\\r\\nside before it falls again.\"\\n\\n\\nTHE TIGER WENT NEXT\\n\\n\"It will require quick work, if we escape the blow,\" said the Tin\\r\\nWoodman, with a shake of his head. \"But it really seems the only thing\\r\\nto be done. Who will make the first attempt?\"\\nThey looked at one another hesitatingly for a moment. Then the Cowardly\\r\\nLion, who was trembling like a leaf in the wind, said to them:\\n\"I suppose the head of the procession must go first—and that\\'s me. But\\r\\nI\\'m terribly afraid of the big hammer!\"\\n\"What will become of me?\" asked Ozma. \"You might rush under the hammer\\r\\nyourself, but the chariot would surely be crushed.\"\\n\"We must leave the chariot,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But you two girls can\\r\\nride upon the backs of the Lion and the Tiger.\"\\nSo this was decided upon, and Ozma, as soon as the Lion was unfastened\\r\\nfrom the chariot, at once mounted the beast\\'s back and said she was\\r\\nready.\\n\"Cling fast to his mane,\" advised Dorothy. \"I used to ride him myself,\\r\\nand that\\'s the way I held on.\"\\nSo Ozma clung fast to the mane, and the lion crouched in the path and\\r\\neyed the swinging mallet[Pg 151] carefully until he knew just the instant it\\r\\nwould begin to rise in the air.\\nThen, before anyone thought he was ready, he made a sudden leap\\r\\nstraight between the iron giant\\'s legs, and before the mallet struck the\\r\\nground again the Lion and Ozma were safe on the other side.\\nThe Tiger went next. Dorothy sat upon his back and locked her arms\\r\\naround his striped neck, for he had no mane to cling to. He made the\\r\\nleap straight and true as an arrow from a bow, and ere Dorothy realized\\r\\nit she was out of danger and standing by Ozma\\'s side.\\nNow came the Scarecrow on the Sawhorse, and while they made the dash in\\r\\nsafety they were within a hair\\'s breadth of being caught by the\\r\\ndescending hammer.\\nTiktok walked up to the very edge of the spot the hammer struck, and as\\r\\nit was raised for the next blow he calmly stepped forward and escaped\\r\\nits descent. That was an idea for the Tin Woodman to follow, and he also\\r\\ncrossed in safety while the great hammer was in the air. But when it\\r\\ncame to the twenty-six officers and the private, their knees were so\\r\\nweak that they could not walk a step.\\n\"In battle we are wonderfully courageous,\" said one of the generals,\\r\\n\"and our foes find us very[Pg 152] terrible to face. But war is one thing and\\r\\nthis is another. When it comes to being pounded upon the head by an iron\\r\\nhammer, and smashed into pancakes, we naturally object.\"\\n\"Make a run for it,\" urged the Scarecrow.\\n\"Our knees shake so that we cannot run,\" answered a captain. \"If we\\r\\nshould try it we would all certainly be pounded to a jelly.\"\\n\"Well, well!\" sighed the Cowardly Lion, \"I see, friend Tiger, that we\\r\\nmust place ourselves in great danger to rescue this bold army. Come with\\r\\nme, and we will do the best we can.\"\\nSo, Ozma and Dorothy having already dismounted from their backs, the\\r\\nLion and the Tiger leaped back again under the awful hammer and returned\\r\\nwith two generals clinging to their necks. They repeated this daring\\r\\npassage twelve times, when all the officers had been carried beneath the\\r\\ngiant\\'s legs and landed safely on the further side. By that time the\\r\\nbeasts were very tired, and panted so hard that their tongues hung out\\r\\nof their great mouths.\\n\"But what is to become of the private?\" asked Ozma.\\n\"Oh, leave him there to guard the chariot,\" said the Lion. \"I\\'m tired\\r\\nout, and won\\'t pass under that mallet again.\"[Pg 153]\\n\\n\\nTHE WOODEN HORSE WAS CARELESS\\n[Pg 154]\\nThe officers at once protested that they must have the private with\\r\\nthem, else there would be no one for them to command. But neither the\\r\\nLion or the Tiger would go after him, and so the Scarecrow sent the\\r\\nSawhorse.\\nEither the wooden horse was careless, or it failed to properly time the\\r\\ndescent of the hammer, for the mighty weapon caught it squarely upon its\\r\\nhead, and thumped it against the ground so powerfully that the private\\r\\nflew off its back high into the air, and landed upon one of the giant\\'s\\r\\ncast-iron arms. Here he clung desperately while the arm rose and fell\\r\\nwith each one of the rapid strokes.\\nThe Scarecrow dashed in to rescue his Sawhorse, and had his left foot\\r\\nsmashed by the hammer before he could pull the creature out of danger.\\r\\nThey then found that the Sawhorse had been badly dazed by the blow; for\\r\\nwhile the hard wooden knot of which his head was formed could not be\\r\\ncrushed by the hammer, both his ears were broken off and he would be\\r\\nunable to hear a sound until some new ones were made for him. Also his\\r\\nleft knee was cracked, and had to be bound up with a string.\\nBillina having fluttered under the hammer, it now remained only to\\r\\nrescue the private who was riding upon the iron giant\\'s arm, high in the\\r\\nair.[Pg 155] The Scarecrow lay flat upon the ground and called to the man to\\r\\njump down upon his body, which was soft because it was stuffed with\\r\\nstraw. This the private managed to do, waiting until a time when he was\\r\\nnearest the ground and then letting himself drop upon the Scarecrow. He\\r\\naccomplished the feat without breaking any bones, and the Scarecrow\\r\\ndeclared he was not injured in the least.\\nTherefore, the Tin Woodman having by this time fitted new ears to the\\r\\nSawhorse, the entire party proceeded upon its way, leaving the giant to\\r\\npound the path behind them.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 156]\\n\\nThe Nome King\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nBy and by, when they drew near to the mountain that blocked their path\\r\\nand which was the furthermost edge of the Kingdom of Ev, the way grew\\r\\ndark and gloomy for the reason that the high peaks on either side shut\\r\\nout the sunshine. And it was very silent, too, as there were no birds to\\r\\nsing or squirrels to chatter, the trees being left far behind them and\\r\\nonly the bare rocks remaining.\\nOzma and Dorothy were a little awed by the silence, and all the others\\r\\nwere quiet and grave except the Sawhorse, which, as it trotted along\\r\\nwith the Scarecrow upon his back, hummed a queer song, of which this was\\r\\nthe chorus:[Pg 157]\\n\\n\"Would a wooden horse in a woodland go?\\nAye, aye! I sigh, he would, although\\nHad he not had a wooden head\\nHe\\'d mount the mountain top instead.\"\\n\\nBut no one paid any attention to this because they were now close to the\\r\\nNome King\\'s dominions, and his splendid underground palace could not be\\r\\nvery far away.\\nSuddenly they heard a shout of jeering laughter, and stopped short. They\\r\\nwould have to stop in a minute, anyway, for the huge mountain barred\\r\\ntheir further progress and the path ran close up to a wall of rock and\\r\\nended.\\n\"Who was that laughing?\" asked Ozma.\\nThere was no reply, but in the gloom they could see strange forms flit\\r\\nacross the face of the rock. Whatever the creations might be they seemed\\r\\nvery like the rock itself, for they were the color of rocks and their\\r\\nshapes were as rough and rugged as if they had been broken away from the\\r\\nside of the mountain. They kept close to the steep cliff facing our\\r\\nfriends, and glided up and down, and this way and that, with a lack of\\r\\nregularity that was quite confusing. And they seemed not to need places\\r\\nto rest their feet, but clung to the surface of the rock as a fly does\\r\\nto a window-pane, and were never still for a moment.[Pg 158]\\n\\n\"Do not mind them,\" said Tiktok, as Dorothy shrank back. \"They are on-ly\\r\\nthe Nomes.\"\\n\"And what are Nomes?\" asked the girl, half frightened.\\n\"They are rock fair-ies, and serve the Nome King,\" replied the machine.\\r\\n\"But they will do us no harm. You must call for the King, be-cause\\r\\nwith-out him you can ne-ver find the en-trance to the pal-ace.\"\\n\"You call,\" said Dorothy to Ozma.\\nJust then the Nomes laughed again, and the sound was so weird and\\r\\ndisheartening that the twenty-six officers commanded the private to\\r\\n\"right-about-face!\" and they all started to run as fast as they could.\\nThe Tin Woodman at once pursued his army and cried \"halt!\" and when they\\r\\nhad stopped their flight he asked: \"Where are you going?\"\\n\"I—I find I\\'ve forgotten the brush for my whiskers,\" said a general,\\r\\ntrembling with fear. \"S-s-so we are g-going back after it!\"\\n\"That is impossible,\" replied the Tin Woodman. \"For the giant with the\\r\\nhammer would kill you all if you tried to pass him.\"\\n\"Oh! I\\'d forgotten the giant,\" said the general, turning pale.[Pg 159]\\n\"You seem to forget a good many things,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"I\\r\\nhope you won\\'t forget that you are brave men.\"\\n\"Never!\" cried the general, slapping his gold-embroidered chest.\\n\"Never!\" cried all the other officers, indignantly slapping their\\r\\nchests.\\n\"For my part,\" said the private, meekly, \"I must obey my officers; so\\r\\nwhen I am told to run, I run; and when I am told to fight, I fight.\"\\n\"That is right,\" agreed the Tin Woodman. \"And now you must all come back\\r\\nto Ozma, and obey her orders. And if you try to run away again I will\\r\\nhave her reduce all the twenty-six officers to privates, and make the\\r\\nprivate your general.\"\\nThis terrible threat so frightened them that they at once returned to\\r\\nwhere Ozma was standing beside the Cowardly Lion.\\nThen Ozma cried out in a loud voice:\\n\"I demand that the Nome King appear to us!\"\\nThere was no reply, except that the shifting Nomes upon the mountain\\r\\nlaughed in derision.\\n\"You must not command the Nome King,\" said Tiktok, \"for you do not rule\\r\\nhim, as you do your own peo-ple.\"\\n\\n\\nONLY THE MOCKING LAUGHTER REPLIED TO HER\\n\\nSo Ozma called again, saying:[Pg 161][Pg 160]\\n\"I request the Nome King to appear to us.\"\\nOnly the mocking laughter replied to her, and the shadowy Nomes\\r\\ncontinued to flit here and there upon the rocky cliff.\\n\"Try en-treat-y,\" said Tiktok to Ozma. \"If he will not come at your\\r\\nre-quest, then the Nome King may list-en to your plead-ing.\"\\nOzma looked around her proudly.\\n\"Do you wish your ruler to plead with this wicked Nome King?\" she asked.\\r\\n\"Shall Ozma of Oz humble herself to a creature who lives in an\\r\\nunderground kingdom?\"\\n\"No!\" they all shouted, with big voices; and the Scarecrow added:\\n\"If he will not come, we will dig him out of his hole, like a fox, and\\r\\nconquer his stubbornness. But our sweet little ruler must always\\r\\nmaintain her dignity, just as I maintain mine.\"\\n\"I\\'m not afraid to plead with him,\" said Dorothy. \"I\\'m only a little\\r\\ngirl from Kansas, and we\\'ve got more dignity at home than we know what\\r\\nto do with. I\\'ll call the Nome King.\"\\n\"Do,\" said the Hungry Tiger; \"and if he makes hash of you I\\'ll willingly\\r\\neat you for breakfast tomorrow morning.\"\\nSo Dorothy stepped forward and said:[Pg 162]\\n\"Please Mr. Nome King, come here and see us.\"\\nThe Nomes started to laugh again; but a low growl came from the\\r\\nmountain, and in a flash they had all vanished from sight and were\\r\\nsilent.\\nThen a door in the rock opened, and a voice cried:\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Enter!\"\\n\"Isn\\'t it a trick?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\\n\"Never mind,\" replied Ozma. \"We came here to rescue the poor Queen of Ev\\r\\nand her ten children, and we must run some risks to do so.\"\\n\"The Nome King is hon-est and good na-tured,\"[Pg 163] said Tiktok. \"You can\\r\\ntrust him to do what is right.\"\\nSo Ozma led the way, hand in hand with Dorothy, and they passed through\\r\\nthe arched doorway of rock and entered a long passage which was lighted\\r\\nby jewels set in the walls and having lamps behind them. There was no\\r\\none to escort them, or to show them the way, but all the party pressed\\r\\nthrough the passage until they came to a round, domed cavern that was\\r\\ngrandly furnished.\\nIn the center of this room was a throne carved out of a solid boulder of\\r\\nrock, rude and rugged in shape but glittering with great rubies and\\r\\ndiamonds and emeralds on every part of its surface. And upon the throne\\r\\nsat the Nome King.\\nThis important monarch of the Underground World was a little fat man\\r\\nclothed in gray-brown garments that were the exact color of the rock\\r\\nthrone in which he was seated. His bushy hair and flowing beard were\\r\\nalso colored like the rocks, and so was his face. He wore no crown of\\r\\nany sort, and his only ornament was a broad, jewel-studded belt that\\r\\nencircled his fat little body. As for his features, they seemed kindly\\r\\nand good humored, and his eyes were turned merrily upon his visitors as\\r\\nOzma and Dorothy stood before him with their[Pg 164] followers ranged in close\\r\\norder behind them.\\n\"Why, he looks just like Santa Claus—only he isn\\'t the same color!\"\\r\\nwhispered Dorothy to her friend; but the Nome King heard the speech, and\\r\\nit made him laugh aloud.\\n\\n\"\\'He had a red face and a round little belly\\nThat shook when he laughed like a bowl full of jelly!\\'\"\\n\\nquoth the monarch, in a pleasant voice; and they could all see that he\\r\\nreally did shake like jelly when he laughed.\\nBoth Ozma and Dorothy were much relieved to find the Nome King so jolly,\\r\\nand a minute later he waved his right hand and the girls each found a\\r\\ncushioned stool at her side.\\n\"Sit down, my dears,\" said the King, \"and tell me why you have come all\\r\\nthis way to see me, and what I can do to make you happy.\"\\nWhile they seated themselves the Nome King picked up a pipe, and taking\\r\\na glowing red coal out of his pocket he placed it in the bowl of the\\r\\npipe and began puffing out clouds of smoke that curled in rings above\\r\\nhis head. Dorothy thought this made the little monarch look more like\\r\\nSanta Claus than ever; but Ozma now began speaking, and every one\\r\\nlistened intently to her words.[Pg 165]\\n\"Your Majesty,\" said she, \"I am the ruler of the Land of Oz, and I have\\r\\ncome here to ask you to release the good Queen of Ev and her ten\\r\\nchildren, whom you have enchanted and hold as your prisoners.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Oh, no; you are mistaken about that,\" replied the King. \"They are not\\r\\nmy prisoners, but my slaves, whom I purchased from the King of Ev.\"\\n\"But that was wrong,\" said Ozma.\\n\"According to the laws of Ev, the king can do no wrong,\" answered the\\r\\nmonarch, eyeing a ring of smoke he had just blown from his mouth; \"so\\r\\nthat[Pg 166] he had a perfect right to sell his family to me in exchange for a\\r\\nlong life.\"\\n\"You cheated him, though,\" declared Dorothy; \"for the King of Ev did not\\r\\nhave a long life. He jumped into the sea and was drowned.\"\\n\"That was not my fault,\" said the Nome King, crossing his legs and\\r\\nsmiling contentedly. \"I gave him the long life, all right; but he\\r\\ndestroyed it.\"\\n\"Then how could it be a long life?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Easily enough,\" was the reply. \"Now suppose, my dear, that I gave you a\\r\\npretty doll in exchange for a lock of your hair, and that after you had\\r\\nreceived the doll you smashed it into pieces and destroyed it. Could you\\r\\nsay that I had not given you a pretty doll?\"\\n\"No,\" answered Dorothy.\\n\"And could you, in fairness, ask me to return to you the lock of hair,\\r\\njust because you had smashed the doll?\"\\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, again.\\n\"Of course not,\" the Nome King returned. \"Nor will I give up the Queen\\r\\nand her children because the King of Ev destroyed his long life by\\r\\njumping into the sea. They belong to me and I shall keep them.\"[Pg 167]\\n\\n\\n\"THEY BELONG TO ME AND I SHALL KEEP THEM\"\\n[Pg 168]\\n\"But you are treating them cruelly,\" said Ozma, who was much distressed\\r\\nby the King\\'s refusal.\\n\"In what way?\" he asked.\\n\"By making them your slaves,\" said she.\\n\"Cruelty,\" remarked the monarch, puffing out wreathes of smoke and\\r\\nwatching them float into the air, \"is a thing I can\\'t abide. So, as\\r\\nslaves must work hard, and the Queen of Ev and her children were\\r\\ndelicate and tender, I transformed them all into articles of ornament\\r\\nand bric-a-brac and scattered them around the various rooms of my\\r\\npalace. Instead of being obliged to labor, they merely decorate my\\r\\napartments, and I really think I have treated them with great kindness.\"\\n\"But what a dreadful fate is theirs!\" exclaimed Ozma, earnestly. \"And\\r\\nthe Kingdom of Ev is in great need of its royal family to govern it. If\\r\\nyou will liberate them, and restore them to their proper forms, I will\\r\\ngive you ten ornaments to replace each one you lose.\"\\nThe Nome King looked grave.\\n\"Suppose I refuse?\" he asked.\\n\"Then,\" said Ozma, firmly, \"I am here with my friends and my army to\\r\\nconquer your kingdom and oblige you to obey my wishes.\"\\nThe Nome King laughed until he choked; and[Pg 169] he choked until he coughed;\\r\\nand he coughed until his face turned from grayish-brown to bright red.\\r\\nAnd then he wiped his eyes with a rock-colored handkerchief and grew\\r\\ngrave again.\\n\"You are as brave as you are pretty, my dear,\" he said to Ozma. \"But you\\r\\nhave little idea of the extent of the task you have undertaken. Come\\r\\nwith me for a moment.\"\\nHe arose and took Ozma\\'s hand, leading her to a little door at one side\\r\\nof the room. This he opened and they stepped out upon a balcony, from\\r\\nwhence they obtained a wonderful view of the Underground World.\\nA vast cave extended for miles and miles under the mountain, and in\\r\\nevery direction were furnaces and forges glowing brightly and Nomes\\r\\nhammering upon precious metals or polishing gleaming jewels. All around\\r\\nthe walls of the cave were thousands of doors of silver and gold, built\\r\\ninto the solid rock, and these extended in rows far away into the\\r\\ndistance, as far as Ozma\\'s eyes could follow them.\\nWhile the little maid from Oz gazed wonderingly upon this scene the Nome\\r\\nKing uttered a shrill whistle, and at once all the silver and gold doors\\r\\nflew open and solid ranks of Nome soldiers marched out from every one.\\r\\nSo great were their numbers[Pg 170] that they quickly filled the immense\\r\\nunderground cavern and forced the busy workmen to abandon their tasks.\\nAlthough this tremendous army consisted of rock-colored Nomes, all squat\\r\\nand fat, they were clothed in glittering armor of polished steel, inlaid\\r\\nwith beautiful gems. Upon his brow each wore a brilliant electric light,\\r\\nand they bore sharp spears and swords and battle-axes of solid bronze.\\r\\nIt was evident they were perfectly trained, for they stood in straight\\r\\nrows, rank after rank, with their weapons held erect and true, as if\\r\\nawaiting but the word of command to level them upon their foes.\\n\"This,\" said the Nome King, \"is but a small part of my army. No ruler\\r\\nupon Earth has ever dared to fight me, and no ruler ever will, for I am\\r\\ntoo powerful to oppose.\"\\nHe whistled again, and at once the martial array filed through the\\r\\nsilver and gold doorways and disappeared, after which the workmen again\\r\\nresumed their labors at the furnaces.\\nThen, sad and discouraged, Ozma of Oz turned to her friends, and the\\r\\nNome King calmly reseated himself on his rock throne.\\n\\n\\n\"THIS IS BUT A SMALL PART OF MY ARMY\"\\n\\n\"It would be foolish for us to fight,\" the girl said to the Tin Woodman.\\r\\n\"For our brave Twenty-[Pg 172][Pg 171]Seven would be quickly destroyed. I\\'m sure I do\\r\\nnot know how to act in this emergency.\"\\n\"Ask the King where his kitchen is,\" suggested the Tiger. \"I\\'m hungry as\\r\\na bear.\"\\n\"I might pounce upon the King and tear him in pieces,\" remarked the\\r\\nCowardly Lion.\\n\"Try it,\" said the monarch, lighting his pipe with another hot coal\\r\\nwhich he took from his pocket.\\nThe Lion crouched low and tried to spring upon the Nome King; but he\\r\\nhopped only a little way into the air and came down again in the same\\r\\nplace, not being able to approach the throne by even an inch.\\n\"It seems to me,\" said the Scarecrow, thoughtfully, \"that our best plan\\r\\nis to wheedle his Majesty into giving up his slaves, since he is too\\r\\ngreat a magician to oppose.\"\\n\"This is the most sensible thing any of you have suggested,\" declared\\r\\nthe Nome King. \"It is folly to threaten me, but I\\'m so kind-hearted that\\r\\nI cannot stand coaxing or wheedling. If you really wish to accomplish\\r\\nanything by your journey, my dear Ozma, you must coax me.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said Ozma, more cheerfully. \"Let us be friends, and talk\\r\\nthis over in a friendly manner.\"[Pg 173]\\n\"To be sure,\" agreed the King, his eyes twinkling merrily.\\n\"I am very anxious,\" she continued, \"to liberate the Queen of Ev and her\\r\\nchildren who are now ornaments and bric-a-brac in your Majesty\\'s palace,\\r\\nand to restore them to their people. Tell me, sir, how this may be\\r\\naccomplished.\"\\nThe king remained thoughtful for a moment, after which he asked:\\n\"Are you willing to take a few chances and risks yourself, in order to\\r\\nset free the people of Ev?\"\\n\"Yes, indeed!\" answered Ozma, eagerly.\\n\"Then,\" said the Nome King, \"I will make you this offer: You shall go\\r\\nalone and unattended into my palace and examine carefully all that the\\r\\nrooms contain. Then you shall have permission to touch eleven different\\r\\nobjects, pronouncing at the time the word \\'Ev,\\' and if any one of them,\\r\\nor more than one, proves to be the transformation of the Queen of Ev or\\r\\nany of her ten children, then they will instantly be restored to their\\r\\ntrue forms and may leave my palace and my kingdom in your company,\\r\\nwithout any objection whatever. It is possible for you, in this way, to\\r\\nfree the entire eleven; but if you do not guess all the objects\\r\\ncorrectly, and some of the slaves remain transformed, then each one of\\r\\nyour[Pg 174] friends and followers may, in turn, enter the palace and have the\\r\\nsame privileges I grant you.\"\\n\"Oh, thank you! thank you for this kind offer!\" said Ozma, eagerly.\\n\"I make but one condition,\" added the Nome King, his eyes twinkling.\\n\"What is it?\" she enquired.\\n\"If none of the eleven objects you touch proves to be the transformation\\r\\nof any of the royal family of Ev, then, instead of freeing them, you\\r\\nwill yourself become enchanted, and transformed into an article of\\r\\nbric-a-brac or an ornament. This is only fair and just, and is the risk\\r\\nyou declared you were willing to take.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 175]\\n\\nThe Eleven Guesses\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nHearing this condition imposed by the Nome King, Ozma became silent and\\r\\nthoughtful, and all her friends looked at her uneasily.\\n\"Don\\'t you do it!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"If you guess wrong, you will be\\r\\nenslaved yourself.\"\\n\"But I shall have eleven guesses,\" answered Ozma. \"Surely I ought to\\r\\nguess one object in eleven correctly; and, if I do, I shall rescue one\\r\\nof the royal family and be safe myself. Then the rest of you may attempt\\r\\nit, and soon we shall free all those who are enslaved.\"\\n\"What if we fail?\" enquired the Scarecrow. \"I\\'d[Pg 176] look nice as a piece of\\r\\nbric-a-brac, wouldn\\'t I?\"\\n\"We must not fail!\" cried Ozma, courageously. \"Having come all this\\r\\ndistance to free these poor people, it would be weak and cowardly in us\\r\\nto abandon the adventure. Therefore I will accept the Nome King\\'s offer,\\r\\nand go at once into the royal palace.\"\\n\"Come along, then, my dear,\" said the King, climbing down from his\\r\\nthrone with some difficulty, because he was so fat; \"I\\'ll show you the\\r\\nway.\"\\nHe approached a wall of the cave and waved his hand. Instantly an\\r\\nopening appeared, through which Ozma, after a smiling farewell to her\\r\\nfriends, boldly passed.\\nShe found herself in a splendid hall that was more beautiful and grand\\r\\nthan anything she had ever beheld. The ceilings were composed of great\\r\\narches that rose far above her head, and all the walls and floors were\\r\\nof polished marble exquisitely tinted in many colors. Thick velvet\\r\\ncarpets were on the floor and heavy silken draperies covered the arches\\r\\nleading to the various rooms of the palace. The furniture was made of\\r\\nrare old woods richly carved and covered with delicate satins, and the\\r\\nentire palace was lighted by a mysterious rosy glow that seemed to come\\r\\nfrom no particular place but flooded[Pg 177] each apartment with its soft and\\r\\npleasing radiance.\\n\\nOzma passed from one room to another, greatly delighted by all she saw.\\r\\nThe lovely palace had no other occupant, for the Nome King had left her\\r\\nat the entrance, which closed behind her, and in all the magnificent\\r\\nrooms there appeared to be no other person.\\nUpon the mantels, and on many shelves and brackets and tables, were\\r\\nclustered ornaments of every description, seemingly made out of all\\r\\nsorts of metals, glass, china, stones and marbles. There were vases, and\\r\\nfigures of men and animals, and graven platters and bowls, and mosaics\\r\\nof precious gems, and many other things. Pictures, too, were on the\\r\\nwalls, and the underground palace was quite a museum of rare and curious\\r\\nand costly objects.\\nAfter her first hasty examination of the rooms Ozma began to wonder\\r\\nwhich of all the numerous ornaments they contained were the\\r\\ntransformations of the royal family of Ev. There was nothing to guide\\r\\nher, for everything seemed without a spark of life. So she must guess\\r\\nblindly; and for the first time the girl came to realize how dangerous\\r\\nwas her task, and how likely she was to lose her own freedom in striving\\r\\nto free others from the bondage of the Nome King. No wonder the\\r\\ncunning[Pg 179][Pg 178] monarch laughed good naturedly with his visitors, when he knew\\r\\nhow easily they might be entrapped.\\n\\n\\nOZMA SHUT HER EYES TIGHTLY AND ADVANCED\\n\\nBut Ozma, having undertaken the venture, would not abandon it. She\\r\\nlooked at a silver candelabra that had ten branches, and thought: \"This\\r\\nmay be the Queen of Ev and her ten children.\" So she touched it and\\r\\nuttered aloud the word \"Ev,\" as the Nome King had instructed her to do\\r\\nwhen she guessed. But the candelabra remained as it was before.\\nThen she wandered into another room and touched a china lamb, thinking\\r\\nit might be one of the children she sought. But again she was\\r\\nunsuccessful. Three guesses; four guesses; five, six, seven, eight, nine\\r\\nand ten she made, and still not one of them was right!\\nThe girl shivered a little and grew pale even under the rosy light; for\\r\\nnow but one guess remained, and her own fate depended upon the result.\\nShe resolved not to be hasty, and strolled through all the rooms once\\r\\nmore, gazing earnestly upon the various ornaments and trying to decide\\r\\nwhich she would touch. Finally, in despair, she decided to leave it\\r\\nentirely to chance. She faced the doorway of a room, shut her eyes\\r\\ntightly, and then, thrusting aside the heavy draperies, she advanced\\r\\nblindly with[Pg 180] her right arm outstretched before her.\\nSlowly, softly she crept forward until her hand came in contact with an\\r\\nobject upon a small round table. She did not know what it was, but in a\\r\\nlow voice she pronounced the word \"Ev.\"\\nThe rooms were quite empty of life after that. The Nome King had gained\\r\\na new ornament. For upon the edge of the table rested a pretty\\r\\ngrasshopper, that seemed to have been formed from a single emerald. It\\r\\nwas all that remained of Ozma of Oz.\\nIn the throne room just beyond the palace the Nome King suddenly looked\\r\\nup and smiled.\\n\"Next!\" he said, in his pleasant voice.\\nDorothy, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, who had been sitting in\\r\\nanxious silence, each gave a start of dismay and stared into one\\r\\nanother\\'s eyes.\\n\"Has she failed?\" asked Tiktok.\\n\"So it seems,\" answered the little monarch, cheerfully. \"But that is no\\r\\nreason one of you should not succeed. The next may have twelve guesses,\\r\\ninstead of eleven, for there are now twelve persons transformed into\\r\\nornaments. Well, well! Which of you goes next?\"\\n\"I\\'ll go,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Not so,\" replied the Tin Woodman. \"As com[Pg 181]mander of Ozma\\'s army, it is\\r\\nmy privilege to follow her and attempt her rescue.\"\\n\"Away you go, then,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But be careful, old friend.\"\\n\"I will,\" promised the Tin Woodman; and then he followed the Nome King\\r\\nto the entrance to the palace and the rock closed behind him.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 182]\\n\\nThe Nome King Laughs\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nIn a moment the King returned to his throne and relighted his pipe, and\\r\\nthe rest of the little band of adventurers settled themselves for\\r\\nanother long wait. They were greatly disheartened by the failure of\\r\\ntheir girl Ruler, and the knowledge that she was now an ornament in the\\r\\nNome King\\'s palace—a dreadful, creepy place in spite of all its\\r\\nmagnificence. Without their little leader they did not know what to do\\r\\nnext, and each one, down to the trembling private of the army, began to\\r\\nfear he would soon be more ornamental than useful.[Pg 183]\\nSuddenly the Nome King began laughing.\\n\"Ha, ha, ha! He, he, he! Ho, ho, ho!\"\\n\"What\\'s happened?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Why, your friend, the Tin Woodman, has become the funniest thing you\\r\\ncan imagine,\" replied the King, wiping the tears of merriment from his\\r\\neyes. \"No one would ever believe he could make such an amusing ornament.\\r\\nNext!\"\\nThey gazed at each other with sinking hearts. One of the generals began\\r\\nto weep dolefully.\\n\"What are you crying for?\" asked the Scarecrow, indignant at such a\\r\\ndisplay of weakness.\\n\"He owed me six weeks back pay,\" said the general, \"and I hate to lose\\r\\nhim.\"\\n\"Then you shall go and find him,\" declared the Scarecrow.\\n\"Me!\" cried the general, greatly alarmed.\\n\"Certainly. It is your duty to follow your commander. March!\"\\n\"I won\\'t,\" said the general. \"I\\'d like to, of course; but I just simply\\r\\nwon\\'t.\"\\nThe Scarecrow looked enquiringly at the Nome King.\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said the jolly monarch. \"If he doesn\\'t care to enter the\\r\\npalace and make his guesses I\\'ll throw him into one of my fiery\\r\\nfurnaces.\"[Pg 184]\\n\"I\\'ll go!—of course I\\'m going,\" yelled the general, as quick as scat.\\r\\n\"Where is the entrance—where is it? Let me go at once!\"\\nSo the Nome King escorted him into the palace, and again returned to\\r\\nawait the result. What the general did, no one can tell; but it was not\\r\\nlong before the King called for the next victim, and a colonel was\\r\\nforced to try his fortune.\\nThus, one after another, all of the twenty-six officers filed into the\\r\\npalace and made their guesses—and became ornaments.\\nMeantime the King ordered refreshments to be served to those waiting,\\r\\nand at his command a rudely shaped Nome entered, bearing a tray. This\\r\\nNome was not unlike the others that Dorothy had seen, but he wore a\\r\\nheavy gold chain around his neck to show that he was the Chief Steward\\r\\nof the Nome King, and he assumed an air of much importance, and even\\r\\ntold his majesty not to eat too much cake late at night, or he would be\\r\\nill.\\nDorothy, however, was hungry, and she was not afraid of being ill; so\\r\\nshe ate several cakes and found them good, and also she drank a cup of\\r\\nexcellent coffee made of a richly flavored clay, browned in the furnaces\\r\\nand then ground fine, and found it most refreshing and not at all\\r\\nmuddy.[Pg 185]\\nOf all the party which had started upon this adventure, the little\\r\\nKansas girl was now left alone with the Scarecrow, Tiktok, and the\\r\\nprivate for counsellors and companions. Of course the Cowardly Lion and\\r\\nthe Hungry Tiger were still there, but they, having also eaten some of\\r\\nthe cakes, had gone to sleep at one side of the cave, while upon the\\r\\nother side stood the Sawhorse, motionless and silent, as became a mere\\r\\nthing of wood. Billina had quietly walked around and picked up the\\r\\ncrumbs of cake which had been scattered, and now, as it was long after\\r\\nbed-time, she tried to find some dark place in which to go to sleep.\\nPresently the hen espied a hollow underneath the King\\'s rocky throne,\\r\\nand crept into it unnoticed. She could still hear the chattering of\\r\\nthose around her, but it was almost dark underneath the throne, so that\\r\\nsoon she had fallen fast asleep.\\n\"Next!\" called the King, and the private, whose turn it was to enter the\\r\\nfatal palace, shook hands with Dorothy and the Scarecrow and bade them a\\r\\nsorrowful good-bye, and passed through the rocky portal.\\nThey waited a long time, for the private was in no hurry to become an\\r\\nornament and made his guesses very slowly. The Nome King, who seemed[Pg 186] to\\r\\nknow, by some magical power, all that took place in his beautiful rooms\\r\\nof his palace, grew impatient finally and declared he would sit up no\\r\\nlonger.\\n\"I love ornaments,\" said he, \"but I can wait until tomorrow to get more\\r\\nof them; so, as soon as that stupid private is transformed, we will all\\r\\ngo to bed and leave the job to be finished in the morning.\"\\n\"Is it so very late?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Why, it is after midnight,\" said the King, \"and that strikes me as\\r\\nbeing late enough. There is neither night nor day in my kingdom, because\\r\\nit is under the earth\\'s surface, where the sun does not shine. But we\\r\\nhave to sleep, just the same as the up-stairs people do, and for my part\\r\\nI\\'m going to bed in a few minutes.\"\\nIndeed, it was not long after this that the private made his last guess.\\r\\nOf course he guessed wrongly, and of course he at once became an\\r\\nornament. So the King was greatly pleased, and clapped his hands to\\r\\nsummon his Chief Steward.\\n\"Show these guests to some of the sleeping apartments,\" he commanded,\\r\\n\"and be quick about it, too, for I\\'m dreadfully sleepy myself.\"\\n\"You\\'ve no business to sit up so late,\" replied the Steward, gruffly.\\r\\n\"You\\'ll be as cross as a griffin tomorrow morning.\"[Pg 187]\\n\\n\\nSOON SHE HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP\\n[Pg 188]\\nHis Majesty made no answer to this remark, and the Chief Steward led\\r\\nDorothy through another doorway into a long hall, from which several\\r\\nplain but comfortable sleeping rooms opened. The little girl was given\\r\\nthe first room, and the Scarecrow and Tiktok the next—although they\\r\\nnever slept—and the Lion and the Tiger the third. The Sawhorse hobbled\\r\\nafter the Steward into a fourth room, to stand stiffly in the center of\\r\\nit until morning. Each night was rather a bore to the Scarecrow, Tiktok\\r\\nand the Sawhorse; but they had learned from experience to pass the time\\r\\npatiently and quietly, since all their friends who were made of flesh\\r\\nhad to sleep and did not like to be disturbed.\\nWhen the Chief Steward had left them alone the Scarecrow remarked,\\r\\nsadly:\\n\"I am in great sorrow over the loss of my old comrade, the Tin Woodman.\\r\\nWe have had many dangerous adventures together, and escaped them all,\\r\\nand now it grieves me to know he has become an ornament, and is lost to\\r\\nme forever.\"\\n\"He was al-ways an or-na-ment to so-ci-e-ty,\" said Tiktok.\\n\"True; but now the Nome King laughs at him, and calls him the funniest\\r\\nornament in all the palace. It will hurt my poor friend\\'s pride to be[Pg 189]\\r\\nlaughed at,\" continued the Scarecrow, sadly.\\n\"We will make rath-er ab-surd or-na-ments, our-selves, to-mor-row,\"\\r\\nobserved the machine, in his monotonous voice.\\nJust then Dorothy ran into their room, in a state of great anxiety,\\r\\ncrying:\\n\"Where\\'s Billina? Have you seen Billina? Is she here?\"\\n\"No,\" answered the Scarecrow.\\n\"Then what has become of her?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Why, I thought she was with you,\" said the Scarecrow. \"Yet I do not\\r\\nremember seeing the yellow hen since she picked up the crumbs of cake.\"\\n\"We must have left her in the room where the King\\'s throne is,\" decided\\r\\nDorothy, and at once she turned and ran down the hall to the door\\r\\nthrough which they had entered. But it was fast closed and locked on the\\r\\nother side, and the heavy slab of rock proved to be so thick that no\\r\\nsound could pass through it. So Dorothy was forced to return to her\\r\\nchamber.\\nThe Cowardly Lion stuck his head into her room to try to console the\\r\\ngirl for the loss of her feathered friend.\\n\"The yellow hen is well able to take care of herself,\" said he; \"so\\r\\ndon\\'t worry about her, but try[Pg 190] to get all the sleep you can. It has\\r\\nbeen a long and weary day, and you need rest.\"\\n\"I\\'ll prob\\'ly get lots of rest tomorrow, when I become an orn\\'ment,\"\\r\\nsaid Dorothy, sleepily. But she lay down upon her couch, nevertheless,\\r\\nand in spite of all her worries was soon in the land of dreams.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 191]\\n\\nDorothy Tries to be Brave\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nMeantime the Chief Steward had returned to the throne room, where he\\r\\nsaid to the King:\\n\"You are a fool to waste so much time upon these people.\"\\n\"What!\" cried his Majesty, in so enraged a voice that it awoke Billina,\\r\\nwho was asleep under his throne. \"How dare you call me a fool?\"\\n\"Because I like to speak the truth,\" said the Steward. \"Why didn\\'t you\\r\\nenchant them all at once, instead of allowing them to go one by one into\\r\\nthe palace and guess which ornaments are the Queen of Ev and her\\r\\nchildren?\"[Pg 192]\\n\"Why, you stupid rascal, it is more fun this way,\" returned the King,\\r\\n\"and it serves to keep me amused for a long time.\"\\n\"But suppose some of them happen to guess aright,\" persisted the\\r\\nSteward; \"then you would lose your old ornaments and these new ones,\\r\\ntoo.\"\\n\"There is no chance of their guessing aright,\" replied the monarch, with\\r\\na laugh. \"How could they know that the Queen of Ev and her family are\\r\\nall ornaments of a royal purple color?\"\\n\"But there are no other purple ornaments in the palace,\" said the\\r\\nSteward.\\n\"There are many other colors, however, and the purple ones are scattered\\r\\nthroughout the rooms, and are of many different shapes and sizes. Take\\r\\nmy word for it, Steward, they will never think of choosing the purple\\r\\nornaments.\"\\nBillina, squatting under the throne, had listened carefully to all this\\r\\ntalk, and now chuckled softly to herself as she heard the King disclose\\r\\nhis secret.\\n\\n\"Still, you are acting foolishly by running the chance,\" continued the\\r\\nSteward, roughly; \"and it is still more foolish of you to transform all\\r\\nthose people from Oz into green ornaments.\"\\n\\n\\n\"HOW DARE YOU CALL ME A FOOL?\"\\n\\n\"I did that because they came from the Emerald[Pg 194][Pg 193] City,\" replied the\\r\\nKing; \"and I had no green ornaments in my collection until now. I think\\r\\nthey will look quite pretty, mixed with the others. Don\\'t you?\"\\nThe Steward gave an angry grunt.\\n\"Have your own way, since you are the King,\" he growled. \"But if you\\r\\ncome to grief through your carelessness, remember that I told you so. If\\r\\nI wore the magic belt which enables you to work all your\\r\\ntransformations, and gives you so much other power, I am sure I would\\r\\nmake a much wiser and better King than you are.\"\\n\"Oh, cease your tiresome chatter!\" commanded the King, getting angry\\r\\nagain. \"Because you are my Chief Steward you have an idea you can scold\\r\\nme as much as you please. But the very next time you become impudent, I\\r\\nwill send you to work in the furnaces, and get another Nome to fill your\\r\\nplace. Now follow me to my chamber, for I am going to bed. And see that\\r\\nI am wakened early tomorrow morning. I want to enjoy the fun of\\r\\ntransforming the rest of these people into ornaments.\"\\n\"What color will you make the Kansas girl?\" asked the Steward.\\n\"Gray, I think,\" said his Majesty.\\n\"And the Scarecrow and the machine man?\"[Pg 195]\\n\"Oh, they shall be of solid gold, because they are so ugly in real\\r\\nlife.\"\\nThen the voices died away, and Billina knew that the King and his\\r\\nSteward had left the room. She fixed up some of her tail feathers that\\r\\nwere not straight, and then tucked her head under her wing again and\\r\\nwent to sleep.\\nIn the morning Dorothy and the Lion and Tiger were given their breakfast\\r\\nin their rooms, and afterward joined the King in his throne room. The\\r\\nTiger complained bitterly that he was half starved, and begged to go\\r\\ninto the palace and become an ornament, so that he would no longer\\r\\nsuffer the pangs of hunger.\\n\"Haven\\'t you had your breakfast?\" asked the Nome King.\\n\"Oh, I had just a bite,\" replied the beast. \"But what good is a bite, to\\r\\na hungry tiger?\"\\n\"He ate seventeen bowls of porridge, a platter full of fried sausages,\\r\\neleven loaves of bread and twenty-one mince pies,\" said the Steward.\\n\"What more do you want?\" demanded the King.\\n\"A fat baby. I want a fat baby,\" said the Hungry Tiger. \"A nice, plump,\\r\\njuicy, tender, fat baby. But, of course, if I had one, my conscience[Pg 196]\\r\\nwould not allow me to eat it. So I\\'ll have to be an ornament and forget\\r\\nmy hunger.\"\\n\"Impossible!\" exclaimed the King. \"I\\'ll have no clumsy beasts enter my\\r\\npalace, to overturn and break all my pretty nick-nacks. When the rest of\\r\\nyour friends are transformed you can return to the upper world, and go\\r\\nabout your business.\"\\n\"As for that we have no business, when our friends are gone,\" said the\\r\\nLion. \"So we do not care much what becomes of us.\"\\nDorothy begged to be allowed to go first into the palace, but Tiktok\\r\\nfirmly maintained that the slave should face danger before the mistress.\\r\\nThe Scarecrow agreed with him in that, so the Nome King opened the door\\r\\nfor the machine man, who tramped into the palace to meet his fate. Then\\r\\nhis Majesty returned to his throne and puffed his pipe so contentedly\\r\\nthat a small cloud of smoke formed above his head.\\nBye and bye he said:\\n\"I\\'m sorry there are so few of you left. Very soon, now, my fun will be\\r\\nover, and then for amusement I shall have nothing to do but admire my\\r\\nnew ornaments.\"\\n\"It seems to me,\" said Dorothy, \"that you are not so honest as you\\r\\npretend to be.\"[Pg 197]\\n\\n\\nTHE NOME KING PUFFED HIS PIPE\\n[Pg 198]\\n\"How\\'s that?\" asked the King.\\n\"Why, you made us think it would be easy to guess what ornaments the\\r\\npeople of Ev were changed into.\"\\n\"It is easy,\" declared the monarch, \"if one is a good guesser. But it\\r\\nappears that the members of your party are all poor guessers.\"\\n\"What is Tiktok doing now?\" asked the girl, uneasily.\\n\"Nothing,\" replied the King, with a frown. \"He is standing perfectly\\r\\nstill, in the middle of a room.\"\\n\"Oh, I expect he\\'s run down,\" said Dorothy. \"I forgot to wind him up\\r\\nthis morning. How many guesses has he made?\"\\n\"All that he is allowed except one,\" answered the King. \"Suppose you go\\r\\nin and wind him up, and then you can stay there and make your own\\r\\nguesses.\"\\n\"All right,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"It is my turn next,\" declared the Scarecrow.\\n\"Why, you don\\'t want to go away and leave me all alone, do you?\" asked\\r\\nthe girl. \"Besides, if I go now I can wind up Tiktok, so that he can\\r\\nmake his last guess.\"\\n\"Very well, then,\" said the Scarecrow, with a sigh.[Pg 199] \"Run along, little\\r\\nDorothy, and may good luck go with you!\"\\nSo Dorothy, trying to be brave in spite of her fears, passed through the\\r\\ndoorway into the gorgeous rooms of the palace. The stillness of the\\r\\nplace awed her, at first, and the child drew short breaths, and pressed\\r\\nher hand to her heart, and looked all around with wondering eyes.\\nYes, it was a beautiful place; but enchantments lurked in every nook and\\r\\ncorner, and she had not yet grown accustomed to the wizardries of these\\r\\nfairy countries, so different from the quiet and sensible common-places\\r\\nof her own native land.\\nSlowly she passed through several rooms until she came upon Tiktok,\\r\\nstanding motionless. It really seemed, then, that she had found a friend\\r\\nin this mysterious palace, so she hastened to wind up the machine man\\'s\\r\\naction and speech and thoughts.\\n\"Thank you, Dor-oth-y,\" were his first words. \"I have now one more guess\\r\\nto make.\"\\n\"Oh, be very careful, Tiktok; won\\'t you?\" cried the girl.\\n\"Yes. But the Nome King has us in his power, and he has set a trap for\\r\\nus. I fear we are all lost,\" he answered.\\n\"I fear so, too,\" said Dorothy, sadly.[Pg 200]\\n\"If Smith & Tin-ker had giv-en me a guess-ing clock-work at-tach-ment,\"\\r\\ncontinued Tiktok, \"I might have de-fied the Nome King. But my thoughts\\r\\nare plain and sim-ple, and are not of much use in this case.\"\\n\"Do the best you can,\" said Dorothy, encouragingly, \"and if you fail I\\r\\nwill watch and see what shape you are changed into.\"\\nSo Tiktok touched a yellow glass vase that had daisies painted on one\\r\\nside, and he spoke at the same time the word \"Ev.\"\\nIn a flash the machine man had disappeared, and although the girl looked\\r\\nquickly in every direction, she could not tell which of the many\\r\\nornaments the room contained had a moment before been her faithful\\r\\nfriend and servant.\\nSo all she could do was to accept the hopeless task set her, and make\\r\\nher guesses and abide by the result.\\n\"It can\\'t hurt very much,\" she thought, \"for I haven\\'t heard any of them\\r\\nscream or cry out—not even the poor officers. Dear me! I wonder if\\r\\nUncle Henry or Aunt Em will ever know I have become an orn\\'ment in the\\r\\nNome King\\'s palace, and must stand forever and ever in one place and\\r\\nlook pretty—\\'cept when I\\'m moved to be dusted.[Pg 201] It isn\\'t the way I\\r\\nthought I\\'d turn out, at all; but I s\\'pose it can\\'t be helped.\"\\nShe walked through all the rooms once more, and examined with care all\\r\\nthe objects they contained; but there were so many, they bewildered her,\\r\\nand she decided, after all, as Ozma had done, that it could be only\\r\\nguess work at the best, and that the chances were much against her\\r\\nguessing aright.\\nTimidly she touched an alabaster bowl and said: \"Ev.\"\\n\"That\\'s one failure, anyhow,\" she thought. \"But how am I to know which\\r\\nthing is enchanted, and which is not?\"\\nNext she touched the image of a purple kitten that stood on the corner\\r\\nof a mantel, and as she pronounced the word \"Ev\" the kitten disappeared,\\r\\nand a pretty, fair-haired boy stood beside her. At the same time a bell\\r\\nrang somewhere in the distance, and as Dorothy started back, partly in\\r\\nsurprise and partly in joy, the little one exclaimed:\\n\"Where am I? And who are you? And what has happened to me?\"\\n\"Well, I declare!\" said Dorothy. \"I\\'ve really done it.\"\\n\"Done what?\" asked the boy.[Pg 202]\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Saved myself from being an ornament,\" replied the girl, with a laugh,\\r\\n\"and saved you from being forever a purple kitten.\"\\n\"A purple kitten?\" he repeated. \"There is no such thing.\"\\n\"I know,\" she answered. \"But there was, a minute ago. Don\\'t you remember\\r\\nstanding on a corner of the mantel?\"[Pg 203]\\n\"Of course not. I am a Prince of Ev, and my name is Evring,\" the little\\r\\none announced, proudly. \"But my father, the King, sold my mother and all\\r\\nher children to the cruel ruler of the Nomes, and after that I remember\\r\\nnothing at all.\"\\n\"A purple kitten can\\'t be \\'spected to remember, Evring,\" said Dorothy.\\r\\n\"But now you are yourself again, and I\\'m going to try to save some of\\r\\nyour brothers and sisters, and perhaps your mother, as well. So come\\r\\nwith me.\"\\nShe seized the child\\'s hand and eagerly hurried here and there, trying\\r\\nto decide which object to choose next. The third guess was another\\r\\nfailure, and so was the fourth and the fifth.\\nLittle Evring could not imagine what she was doing, but he trotted along\\r\\nbeside her very willingly, for he liked the new companion he had found.\\nDorothy\\'s further quest proved unsuccessful; but after her first\\r\\ndisappointment was over, the little girl was filled with joy and\\r\\nthankfulness to think that after all she had been able to save one\\r\\nmember of the royal family of Ev, and could restore the little Prince to\\r\\nhis sorrowing country. Now she might return to the terrible Nome King in\\r\\nsafety, carrying with her the prize she had won in the person of the\\r\\nfair-haired boy.[Pg 204]\\nSo she retraced her steps until she found the entrance to the palace,\\r\\nand as she approached, the massive doors of rock opened of their own\\r\\naccord, allowing both Dorothy and Evring to pass the portals and enter\\r\\nthe throne room.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 205]\\n\\nBillina Frightens the Nome King\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nNow when Dorothy had entered the palace to make her guesses and the\\r\\nScarecrow was left with the Nome King, the two sat in moody silence for\\r\\nseveral minutes. Then the monarch exclaimed, in a tone of satisfaction:\\n\"Very good!\"\\n\"Who is very good?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"The machine man. He won\\'t need to be wound up any more, for he has now\\r\\nbecome a very neat ornament. Very neat, indeed.\"\\n\"How about Dorothy?\" the Scarecrow enquired.[Pg 206]\\n\"Oh, she will begin to guess, pretty soon,\" said the King, cheerfully.\\r\\n\"And then she will join my collection, and it will be your turn.\"\\nThe good Scarecrow was much distressed by the thought that his little\\r\\nfriend was about to suffer the fate of Ozma and the rest of their party;\\r\\nbut while he sat in gloomy reverie a shrill voice suddenly cried:\\n\\n\"Kut, kut, kut—ka-daw-kutt! Kut, kut, kut—ka-daw-kutt!\"\\nThe Nome King nearly jumped off his seat, he was so startled.\\n\"Good gracious! What\\'s that?\" he yelled.\\n\"Why, it\\'s Billina,\" said the Scarecrow.\\n\"What do you mean by making a noise like that?\" shouted the King,\\r\\nangrily, as the yellow hen came from under the throne and strutted\\r\\nproudly about the room.\\n\"I\\'ve got a right to cackle, I guess,\" replied Billina. \"I\\'ve just laid\\r\\nmy egg.\\'\\n\"What! Laid an egg! In my throne room! How dare you do such a thing?\"\\r\\nasked the King, in a voice of fury.\\n\"I lay eggs wherever I happen to be,\" said the hen, ruffling her\\r\\nfeathers and then shaking them into place.[Pg 207]\\n\"But—thunder-ation! Don\\'t you know that eggs are poison?\" roared the\\r\\nKing, while his rock-colored eyes stuck out in great terror.\\n\"Poison! well, I declare,\" said Billina, indignantly. \"I\\'ll have you\\r\\nknow all my eggs are warranted strictly fresh and up to date. Poison,\\r\\nindeed!\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand,\" retorted the little monarch, nervously. \"Eggs\\r\\nbelong only to the outside world—to the world on the earth\\'s surface,\\r\\nwhere you came from. Here, in my underground kingdom, they are rank\\r\\npoison, as I said, and we Nomes can\\'t bear them around.\"\\n\"Well, you\\'ll have to bear this one around,\" declared Billina; \"for I\\'ve\\r\\nlaid it.\"\\n\"Where?\" asked the King.\\n\"Under your throne,\" said the hen.\\nThe King jumped three feet into the air, so anxious was he to get away\\r\\nfrom the throne.\\n\"Take it away! Take it away at once!\" he shouted.\\n\"I can\\'t,\" said Billina. \"I havn\\'t any hands.\"\\n\"I\\'ll take the egg,\" said the Scarecrow. \"I\\'m making a collection of\\r\\nBillina\\'s eggs. There\\'s one in my pocket now, that she laid yesterday.\"\\nHearing this, the monarch hastened to put a good distance between\\r\\nhimself and the Scarecrow,[Pg 208] who was about to reach under the throne for\\r\\nthe egg when the hen suddenly cried:\\n\"Stop!\"\\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Don\\'t take the egg unless the King will allow me to enter the palace\\r\\nand guess as the others have done,\" said Billina.\\n\"Pshaw!\" returned the King. \"You\\'re only a hen. How could you guess my\\r\\nenchantments?\"\\n\"I can try, I suppose,\" said Billina. \"And, if I fail, you will have\\r\\nanother ornament.\"\\n\"A pretty ornament you\\'d make, wouldn\\'t you?\" growled the King. \"But you\\r\\nshall have your way. It will properly punish you for daring to lay an\\r\\negg in my presence. After the Scarecrow is enchanted you shall follow\\r\\nhim into the palace. But how will you touch the objects?\"\\n\"With my claws,\" said the hen; \"and I can speak the word \\'Ev\\' as plainly\\r\\nas anyone. Also I must have the right to guess the enchantments of my\\r\\nfriends, and to release them if I succeed.\"\\n\"Very well,\" said the King. \"You have my promise.\"\\n\"Then,\" said Billina to the Scarecrow, \"you may get the egg.\"\\n\\n\\n\"DON\\'T YOU KNOW THAT EGGS ARE POISON?\"\\n\\nHe knelt down and reached underneath the[Pg 210][Pg 209] throne and found the egg,\\r\\nwhich he placed in another pocket of his jacket, fearing that if both\\r\\neggs were in one pocket they would knock together and get broken.\\nJust then a bell above the throne rang briskly, and the King gave\\r\\nanother nervous jump.\\n\"Well, well!\" said he, with a rueful face; \"the girl has actually done\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"Done what?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"She has made one guess that is right, and broken one of my neatest\\r\\nenchantments. By ricketty, it\\'s too bad! I never thought she would do\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"Do I understand that she will now return to us in safety?\" enquired the\\r\\nScarecrow, joyfully wrinkling his painted face into a broad smile.\\n\"Of course,\" said the King, fretfully pacing up and down the room. \"I\\r\\nalways keep my promises, no matter how foolish they are. But I shall\\r\\nmake an ornament of the yellow hen to replace the one I have just lost.\"\\n\"Perhaps you will, and perhaps you won\\'t,\" murmured Billina, calmly. \"I\\r\\nmay surprise you by guessing right.\"\\n\"Guessing right?\" snapped the King. \"How should you guess right, where\\r\\nyour betters have failed, you stupid fowl?\"[Pg 211]\\nBillina did not care to answer this question, and a moment later the\\r\\ndoors flew open and Dorothy entered, leading the little Prince Evring by\\r\\nthe hand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Scarecrow welcomed the girl with a close embrace, and he would have\\r\\nembraced Evring, too, in his delight. But the little Prince was shy, and\\r\\nshrank away from the painted Scarecrow because he did not yet know his\\r\\nmany excellent qualities.\\n\\n\\n\"BY RICKETTY, IT\\'S TOO BAD!\"\\n\\nBut there was little time for the friends to talk, because the Scarecrow\\r\\nmust now enter the palace.[Pg 213][Pg 212] Dorothy\\'s success had greatly encouraged\\r\\nhim, and they both hoped he would manage to make at least one correct\\r\\nguess.\\nHowever, he proved as unfortunate as the others except Dorothy, and\\r\\nalthough he took a good deal of time to select his objects, not one did\\r\\nthe poor Scarecrow guess aright.\\nSo he became a solid gold card-receiver, and the beautiful but terrible\\r\\npalace awaited its next visitor.\\n\"It\\'s all over,\" remarked the King, with a sigh of satisfaction; \"and it\\r\\nhas been a very amusing performance, except for the one good guess the\\r\\nKansas girl made. I am richer by a great many pretty ornaments.\\n\"It is my turn, now,\" said Billina, briskly.\\n\"Oh, I\\'d forgotten you,\" said the King. \"But you needn\\'t go if you don\\'t\\r\\nwish to. I will be generous, and let you off.\"\\n\"No you won\\'t,\" replied the hen. \"I insist upon having my guesses, as\\r\\nyou promised.\"\\n\"Then go ahead, you absurd feathered fool!\" grumbled the King, and he\\r\\ncaused the opening that led to the palace to appear once more.\\n\"Don\\'t go, Billina,\" said Dorothy, earnestly. \"It isn\\'t easy to guess\\r\\nthose orn\\'ments, and only luck saved me from being one myself. Stay with\\r\\nme,[Pg 214] and we\\'ll go back to the Land of Ev together. I\\'m sure this little\\r\\nPrince will give us a home.\"\\n\"Indeed I will,\" said Evring, with much dignity.\\n\"Don\\'t worry, my dear,\" cried Billina, with a cluck that was meant for a\\r\\nlaugh. \"I may not be human, but I\\'m no fool, if I am a chicken.\"\\n\"Oh, Billina!\" said Dorothy, \"you haven\\'t been a chicken in a long time.\\r\\nNot since you—you\\'ve been—grown up.\"\\n\"Perhaps that\\'s true,\" answered Billina, thoughtfully. \"But if a Kansas\\r\\nfarmer sold me to some one, what would he call me?—a hen or a chicken!\"\\n\"You are not a Kansas farmer, Billina,\" replied the girl, \"and you\\r\\nsaid—\"\\n\"Never mind that, Dorothy. I\\'m going. I won\\'t say good-bye, because I\\'m\\r\\ncoming back. Keep up your courage, for I\\'ll see you a little later.\"\\nThen Billina gave several loud \"cluck-clucks\" that seemed to make the\\r\\nfat little King more nervous than ever, and marched through the\\r\\nentrance into the enchanted palace.\\n\"I hope I\\'ve seen the last of that bird,\" declared the monarch,\\r\\nseating himself again in his throne and mopping the perspiration from\\r\\nhis forehead with his rock-colored handkerchief. \"Hens are bothersome[Pg 215]\\r\\nenough at their best, but when they can talk they\\'re simply dreadful.\"\\n\"Billina\\'s my friend,\" said Dorothy quietly. \"She may not always be\\r\\n\\'zactly polite; but she means well, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 216]\\n\\nPurple, Green and Gold\\n\\n \\n \\nThe yellow hen, stepping high and with an air of vast importance, walked\\r\\nslowly over the rich velvet carpets of the splendid palace, examining\\r\\neverything she met with her sharp little eyes.\\nBillina had a right to feel important; for she alone shared the Nome\\r\\nKing\\'s secret and knew how to tell the objects that were transformations\\r\\nfrom those that had never been alive. She was very sure that her guesses\\r\\nwould be correct, but before she began to make them she was curious to\\r\\nbehold all the magnificence of this underground palace, which was\\r\\nperhaps one of[Pg 217] the most splendid and beautiful places in any fairyland.\\nAs she went through the rooms she counted the purple ornaments; and\\r\\nalthough some were small and hidden in queer places, Billina spied them\\r\\nall, and found the entire ten scattered about the various rooms. The\\r\\ngreen ornaments she did not bother to count, for she thought she could\\r\\nfind them all when the time came.\\n\\nFinally, having made a survey of the entire palace and enjoyed its\\r\\nsplendor, the yellow hen returned to one of the rooms where she had\\r\\nnoticed a large purple footstool. She placed a claw upon this and said\\r\\n\"Ev,\" and at once the footstool vanished and a lovely lady, tall and\\r\\nslender and most beautifully robed, stood before her.\\nThe lady\\'s eyes were round with astonishment for a moment, for she could\\r\\nnot remember her transformation, nor imagine what had restored her to\\r\\nlife.\\n\"Good morning, ma\\'am,\" said Billina, in her sharp voice. \"You\\'re looking\\r\\nquite well, considering your age.\"\\n\"Who speaks?\" demanded the Queen of Ev, drawing herself up proudly.\\n\"Why, my name\\'s Bill, by rights,\" answered the[Pg 218] hen, who was now perched\\r\\nupon the back of a chair; \"although Dorothy has put scollops on it and\\r\\nmade it Billina. But the name doesn\\'t matter. I\\'ve saved you from the\\r\\nNome King, and you are a slave no longer.\"\\n\"Then I thank you for the gracious favor,\" said the Queen, with a\\r\\ngraceful courtesy. \"But, my children—tell me, I beg of you—where are\\r\\nmy children?\" and she clasped her hands in anxious entreaty.\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" advised Billina, pecking at a tiny bug that was crawling\\r\\nover the chair back. \"Just at present they are out of mischief and\\r\\nperfectly safe, for they can\\'t even wiggle.\"\\n\"What mean you, O kindly stranger?\" asked the Queen, striving to repress\\r\\nher anxiety.\\n\"They\\'re enchanted,\" said Billina, \"just as you have been—all, that is,\\r\\nexcept the little fellow Dorothy picked out. And the chances are that\\r\\nthey have been good boys and girls for some time, because they couldn\\'t\\r\\nhelp it.\"\\n\"Oh, my poor darlings!\" cried the Queen, with a sob of anguish.\\n\"Not at all,\" returned the hen. \"Don\\'t let their condition make you\\r\\nunhappy, ma\\'am, because I\\'ll soon have them crowding \\'round to bother\\r\\nand[Pg 219] worry you as naturally as ever. Come with me, if you please, and\\r\\nI\\'ll show you how pretty they look.\"\\nShe flew down from her perch and walked into the next room, the Queen\\r\\nfollowing. As she passed a low table a small green grasshopper caught\\r\\nher eye, and instantly Billina pounced upon it and snapped it up in her\\r\\nsharp bill. For grasshoppers are a favorite food with hens, and they\\r\\nusually must be caught quickly, before they can hop away. It might\\r\\neasily have been the end of Ozma of Oz, had she been a real grasshopper\\r\\ninstead of an emerald one. But Billina found the grasshopper hard and\\r\\nlifeless, and suspecting it was not good to eat she quickly dropped it\\r\\ninstead of letting it slide down her throat.\\n\"I might have known better,\" she muttered to herself, \"for where there\\r\\nis no grass there can be no live grasshoppers. This is probably one of\\r\\nthe King\\'s transformations.\"\\nA moment later she approached one of the purple ornaments, and while the\\r\\nQueen watched her curiously the hen broke the Nome King\\'s enchantment\\r\\nand a sweet-faced girl, whose golden hair fell in a cloud over her\\r\\nshoulders, stood beside them.\\n\"Evanna!\" cried the Queen, \"my own Evanna!\"[Pg 220] and she clasped the girl to\\r\\nher bosom and covered her face with kisses.\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" said Billina, contentedly. \"Am I a good guesser, Mr.\\r\\nNome King? Well, I guess!\"\\nThen she disenchanted another girl, whom the Queen addressed as Evrose,\\r\\nand afterwards a boy named Evardo, who was older than his brother\\r\\nEvring. Indeed, the yellow hen kept the good Queen exclaiming and\\r\\nembracing for some time, until five Princesses and four Princes, all\\r\\nlooking very much alike except for the difference in size, stood in a\\r\\nrow beside their happy mother.\\nThe Princesses were named, Evanna, Evrose, Evella, Evirene and Evedna,\\r\\nwhile the Princes were Evrob, Evington, Evardo and Evroland. Of these\\r\\nEvardo was the eldest and would inherit his father\\'s throne and be\\r\\ncrowned King of Ev when he returned to his own country. He was a grave\\r\\nand quiet youth, and would doubtless rule his people wisely and with\\r\\njustice.\\n\\n\\nTHE QUEEN OF EV THANKS BILLINA\\n\\nBillina, having restored all of the royal family of Ev to their proper\\r\\nforms, now began to select the green ornaments which were the\\r\\ntransformations of the people of Oz. She had little trouble in finding\\r\\nthese, and before long all the twenty-six officers, as well as the\\r\\nprivate, were gathered around the[Pg 222][Pg 221] yellow hen, joyfully congratulating\\r\\nher upon their release. The thirty-seven people who were now alive in\\r\\nthe rooms of the palace knew very well that they owed their freedom to\\r\\nthe cleverness of the yellow hen, and they were earnest in thanking her\\r\\nfor saving them from the magic of the Nome King.\\n\"Now,\" said Billina, \"I must find Ozma. She is sure to be here,\\r\\nsomewhere, and of course she is green, being from Oz. So look around,\\r\\nyou stupid soldiers, and help me in my search.\"\\nFor a while, however, they could discover nothing more that was green.\\r\\nBut the Queen, who had kissed all her nine children once more and could\\r\\nnow find time to take an interest in what was going on, said to the hen:\\n\"Mayhap, my gentle friend, it is the grasshopper whom you seek.\"\\n\"Of course it\\'s the grasshopper!\" exclaimed Billina. \"I declare, I\\'m\\r\\nnearly as stupid as these brave soldiers. Wait here for me, and I\\'ll go\\r\\nback and get it.\"\\nSo she went into the room where she had seen the grasshopper, and\\r\\npresently Ozma of Oz, as lovely and dainty as ever, entered and\\r\\napproached the Queen of Ev, greeting her as one high born princess\\r\\ngreets another.[Pg 223]\\n\"But where are my friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman?\" asked the\\r\\ngirl Ruler, when these courtesies had been exchanged.\\n\"I\\'ll hunt them up,\" replied Billina. \"The Scarecrow is solid gold, and\\r\\nso is Tiktok; but I don\\'t exactly know what the Tin Woodman is, because\\r\\nthe Nome King said he had been transformed into something funny.\"\\nOzma eagerly assisted the hen in her quest, and soon the Scarecrow and\\r\\nthe machine man, being ornaments of shining gold, were discovered and\\r\\nrestored to their accustomed forms. But, search as they might, in no\\r\\nplace could they find a funny ornament that might be the transformation\\r\\nof the Tin Woodman.\\n\"Only one thing can be done,\" said Ozma, at last, \"and that is to return\\r\\nto the Nome King and oblige him to tell us what has become of our\\r\\nfriend.\"\\n\"Perhaps he won\\'t,\" suggested Billina.\\n\"He must,\" returned Ozma, firmly. \"The King has not treated us honestly,\\r\\nfor under the mask of fairness and good nature he entrapped us all, and\\r\\nwe would have been forever enchanted had not our wise and clever friend,\\r\\nthe yellow hen, found a way to save us.\"\\n\"The King is a villain,\" declared the Scarecrow.[Pg 224]\\n\"His laugh is worse than another man\\'s frown,\" said the private, with a\\r\\nshudder.\\n\"I thought he was hon-est, but I was mis-tak-en,\" remarked Tiktok. \"My\\r\\nthoughts are us-u-al-ly cor-rect, but it is Smith & Tin-ker\\'s fault if\\r\\nthey some-times go wrong or do not work prop-er-ly.\"\\n\"Smith & Tinker made a very good job of you,\" said Ozma, kindly. \"I do\\r\\nnot think they should be blamed if you are not quite perfect.\"\\n\"Thank you,\" replied Tiktok.\\n\"Then,\" said Billina, in her brisk little voice, \"let us all go back to\\r\\nthe Nome King, and see what he has to say for himself.\"\\nSo they started for the entrance, Ozma going first, with the Queen and\\r\\nher train of little Princes and Princesses following. Then came Tiktok,\\r\\nand the Scarecrow with Billina perched upon his straw-stuffed shoulder.\\r\\nThe twenty-seven officers and the private brought up the rear.\\nAs they reached the hall the doors flew open before them; but then they\\r\\nall stopped and stared into the domed cavern with faces of astonishment\\r\\nand dismay. For the room was filled with the mail-clad warriors of the\\r\\nNome King, rank after rank standing in orderly array. The electric\\r\\nlights upon their brows gleamed brightly, their battle-axes[Pg 225] were poised\\r\\nas if to strike down their foes; yet they remained motionless as\\r\\nstatues, awaiting the word of command.\\nAnd in the center of this terrible army sat the little King upon his\\r\\nthrone of rock. But he neither smiled nor laughed. Instead, his face was\\r\\ndistorted with rage, and most dreadful to behold.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 226]\\n\\nThe Scarecrow Wins the Fight\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nAfter Billina had entered the palace Dorothy and Evring sat down to\\r\\nawait the success or failure of her mission, and the Nome King occupied\\r\\nhis throne and smoked his long pipe for a while in a cheerful and\\r\\ncontented mood.\\nThen the bell above the throne, which sounded whenever an enchantment\\r\\nwas broken, began to ring, and the King gave a start of annoyance and\\r\\nexclaimed, \"Rocketty-ricketts!\"\\nWhen the bell rang a second time the King shouted angrily, \"Smudge and\\r\\nblazes!\" and at a third ring he screamed in a fury, \"Hippikaloric!\"[Pg 227]\\r\\nwhich must be a dreadful word because we don\\'t know what it means.\\nAfter that the bell went on ringing time after time; but the King was\\r\\nnow so violently enraged that he could not utter a word, but hopped out\\r\\nof his throne and all around the room in a mad frenzy, so that he\\r\\nreminded Dorothy of a jumping-jack.\\nThe girl was, for her part, filled with joy at every peal of the bell,\\r\\nfor it announced the fact that Billina had transformed one more ornament\\r\\ninto a living person. Dorothy was also amazed at Billina\\'s success, for\\r\\nshe could not imagine how the yellow hen was able to guess correctly\\r\\nfrom all the bewildering number of articles clustered in the rooms of\\r\\nthe palace. But after she had counted ten, and the bell continued to\\r\\nring, she knew that not only the royal family of Ev, but Ozma and her\\r\\nfollowers also, were being restored to their natural forms, and she was\\r\\nso delighted that the antics of the angry King only made her laugh\\r\\nmerrily.\\nPerhaps the little monarch could not be more furious than he was before,\\r\\nbut the girl\\'s laughter nearly drove him frantic, and he roared at her\\r\\nlike a savage beast. Then, as he found that all his enchantments were\\r\\nlikely to be dispelled and his victims every one set free, he suddenly\\r\\nran to the[Pg 228] little door that opened upon the balcony and gave the shrill\\r\\nwhistle that summoned his warriors.\\nAt once the army filed out of the gold and silver doors in great\\r\\nnumbers, and marched up a winding stairs and into the throne room, led\\r\\nby a stern featured Nome who was their captain. When they had nearly\\r\\nfilled the throne room they formed ranks in the big underground cavern\\r\\nbelow, and then stood still until they were told what to do next.\\n\\nDorothy had pressed back to one side of the cavern when the warriors\\r\\nentered, and now she stood holding little Prince Evring\\'s hand while the\\r\\ngreat Lion crouched upon one side and the enormous Tiger crouched an the\\r\\nother side.\\n\"Seize that girl!\" shouted the King to his captain, and a group of\\r\\nwarriors sprang forward to obey. But both the Lion and Tiger snarled so\\r\\nfiercely and bared their strong, sharp teeth so threateningly, that the\\r\\nmen drew back in alarm.\\n\"Don\\'t mind them!\" cried the Nome King; \"they cannot leap beyond the\\r\\nplaces where they now stand.\"\\n\"But they can bite those who attempt to touch the girl,\" said the\\r\\ncaptain.\\n\"I\\'ll fix that,\" answered the King. \"I\\'ll enchant them again, so that\\r\\nthey can\\'t open their jaws.\"[Pg 229]\\nHe stepped out of the throne to do this, but just then the Sawhorse ran\\r\\nup behind him and gave the fat monarch a powerful kick with both his\\r\\nwooden hind legs.\\n\"Ow! Murder! Treason!\" yelled the King, who had been hurled against\\r\\nseveral of his warriors and was considerably bruised. \"Who did that?\"\\n\"I did,\" growled the Sawhorse, viciously. \"You let Dorothy alone, or\\r\\nI\\'ll kick you again.\"\\n\"We\\'ll see about that,\" replied the King, and at once he waved his hand\\r\\ntoward the Sawhorse and muttered a magical word. \"Aha!\" he continued;\\r\\n\"now let us see you move, you wooden mule!\"\\nBut in spite of the magic the Sawhorse moved; and he moved so quickly\\r\\ntoward the King, that the fat little man could not get out of his way.\\r\\nThump—bang! came the wooden heels, right against his round body, and\\r\\nthe King flew into the air and fell upon the head of his captain, who\\r\\nlet him drop flat upon the ground.\\n\"Well, well!\" said the King, sitting up and looking surprised. \"Why\\r\\ndidn\\'t my magic belt work, I wonder?\"\\n\"The creature is made of wood,\" replied the captain. \"Your magic will\\r\\nnot work on wood, you know.\"[Pg 230]\\n\"Ah, I\\'d forgotten that,\" said the King, getting up and limping to his\\r\\nthrone. \"Very well, let the girl alone. She can\\'t escape us, anyway.\"\\nThe warriors, who had been rather confused by these incidents, now\\r\\nformed their ranks again, and the Sawhorse pranced across the room to\\r\\nDorothy and took a position beside the Hungry Tiger.\\nAt that moment the doors that led to the palace flew open and the people\\r\\nof Ev and the people of Oz were disclosed to view. They paused,\\r\\nastonished, at sight of the warriors and the angry Nome King, seated in\\r\\ntheir midst.\\n\"Surrender!\" cried the King, in a loud voice. \"You are my prisoners.\"\\n\"Go \\'long!\" answered Billina, from the Scarecrow\\'s shoulder. \"You\\r\\npromised me that if I guessed correctly my friends and I might depart in\\r\\nsafety. And you always keep your promises.\"\\n\"I said you might leave the palace in safety,\" retorted the King; \"and\\r\\nso you may, but you cannot leave my dominions. You are my prisoners, and\\r\\nI will hurl you all into my underground dungeons, where the volcanic\\r\\nfires glow and the molten lava flows in every direction, and the air is\\r\\nhotter than blue blazes.\"\\n\\n\\n\"HELP, HELP!\" SCREAMED THE KING\\n\\n\"That will be the end of me, all right,\" said the[Pg 232][Pg 231] Scarecrow,\\r\\nsorrowfully. \"One small blaze, blue or green, is enough to reduce me to\\r\\nan ash-heap.\"\\n\"Do you surrender?\" demanded the King.\\nBillina whispered something in the Scarecrow\\'s ear that made him smile\\r\\nand put his hands in his jacket pockets.\\n\"No!\" returned Ozma, boldly answering the King. Then she said to her\\r\\narmy:\\n\"Forward, my brave soldiers, and fight for your Ruler and yourselves,\\r\\nunto death!\"\\n\"Pardon me, Most Royal Ozma,\" replied one of her generals; \"but I find\\r\\nthat I and my brother officers all suffer from heart disease, and the\\r\\nslightest excitement might kill us. If we fight we may get excited.\\r\\nWould it not be well for us to avoid this grave danger?\"\\n\"Soldiers should not have heart disease,\" said Ozma.\\n\"Private soldiers are not, I believe, afflicted that way,\" declared\\r\\nanother general, twirling his moustache thoughtfully. \"If your Royal\\r\\nHighness desires, we will order our private to attack yonder warriors.\"\\n\"Do so,\" replied Ozma.\\n\"For-ward—march!\" cried all the generals, with one voice.\\r\\n\"For-ward—march!\" yelled the colonels. \"For-ward—march!\" shouted the\\r\\nmajors.[Pg 233] \"For-ward—march!\" commanded the captains.\\nAnd at that the private leveled his spear and dashed furiously upon the\\r\\nfoe.\\nThe captain of the Nomes was so surprised by this sudden onslaught that\\r\\nhe forgot to command his warriors to fight, so that the ten men in the\\r\\nfirst row, who stood in front of the private\\'s spear, fell over like so\\r\\nmany toy soldiers. The spear could not go through their steel armor,\\r\\nhowever, so the warriors scrambled to their feet again, and by that time\\r\\nthe private had knocked over another row of them.\\nThen the captain brought down his battle-axe with such a strong blow\\r\\nthat the private\\'s spear was shattered and knocked from his grasp, and\\r\\nhe was helpless to fight any longer.\\nThe Nome King had left his throne and pressed through his warriors to\\r\\nthe front ranks, so he could see what was going on; but as he faced Ozma\\r\\nand her friends the Scarecrow, as if aroused to action by the valor of\\r\\nthe private, drew one of Billina\\'s eggs from his right jacket pocket and\\r\\nhurled it straight at the little monarch\\'s head.\\nIt struck him squarely in his left eye, where the egg smashed and\\r\\nscattered, as eggs will, and covered his face and hair and beard with\\r\\nits sticky contents.[Pg 234]\\n\"Help, help!\" screamed the King, clawing with his fingers at the egg, in\\r\\na struggle to remove it.\\n\"An egg! an egg! Run for your lives!\" shouted the captain of the Nomes,\\r\\nin a voice of horror.\\nAnd how they did run! The warriors fairly tumbled over one another in\\r\\ntheir efforts to escape the fatal poison of that awful egg, and those\\r\\nwho could not rush down the winding stair fell off the balcony into the\\r\\ngreat cavern beneath, knocking over those who stood below them.\\nEven while the King was still yelling for help his throne room became\\r\\nemptied of every one of his warriors, and before the monarch had managed\\r\\nto clear the egg away from his left eye the Scarecrow threw the second\\r\\negg against his right eye, where it smashed and blinded him entirely.\\r\\nThe King was unable to flee because he could not see which way to run;\\r\\nso he stood still and howled and shouted and screamed in abject fear.\\nWhile this was going on, Billina flew over to Dorothy, and perching\\r\\nherself upon the Lion\\'s back the hen whispered eagerly to the girl:\\n\"Get his belt! Get the Nome King\\'s jeweled belt! It unbuckles in the\\r\\nback. Quick, Dorothy—quick!\"[Pg 235]\\n\\nThe Fate of the Tin Woodman\\n\\n \\n \\nDorothy obeyed. She ran at once behind the Nome King, who was still\\r\\ntrying to free his eyes from the egg, and in a twinkling she had\\r\\nunbuckled his splendid jeweled belt and carried it away with her to her\\r\\nplace beside the Tiger and Lion, where, because she did not know what\\r\\nelse to do with it, she fastened it around her own slim waist.\\nJust then the Chief Steward rushed in with a sponge and a bowl of water,\\r\\nand began mopping away the broken eggs from his master\\'s face. In a few\\r\\nminutes, and while all the party stood looking on, the King regained\\r\\nthe[Pg 236] use of his eyes, and the first thing he did was to glare wickedly\\r\\nupon the Scarecrow and exclaim:\\n\"I\\'ll make you suffer for this, you hay-stuffed dummy! Don\\'t you know\\r\\neggs are poison to Nomes?\"\\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"they don\\'t seem to agree with you,\\r\\nalthough I wonder why.\"\\n\\n\"They were strictly fresh and above suspicion,\" said Billina. \"You ought\\r\\nto be glad to get them.\"\\n\"I\\'ll transform you all into scorpions!\" cried the King, angrily, and\\r\\nbegan waving his arms and muttering magic words.\\nBut none of the people became scorpions, so the King stopped and looked\\r\\nat them in surprise.\\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" he asked.\\n\"Why, you are not wearing your magic belt,\" replied the Chief Steward,\\r\\nafter looking the King over carefully. \"Where is it? What have you done\\r\\nwith it?\"\\nThe Nome King clapped his hand to his waist, and his rock colored face\\r\\nturned white as chalk.\\n\"It\\'s gone,\" he cried, helplessly. \"It\\'s gone, and I am ruined!\"\\nDorothy now stepped forward and said:\\n\"Royal Ozma, and you, Queen of Ev, I welcome you and your people back to\\r\\nthe land of the living.[Pg 237] Billina has saved you from your troubles, and\\r\\nnow we will leave this drea\\'ful place, and return to Ev as soon as\\r\\nposs\\'ble.\"\\nWhile the child spoke they could all see that she wore the magic belt,\\r\\nand a great cheer went up from all her friends, which was led by the\\r\\nvoices of the Scarecrow and the private. But the Nome King did not join\\r\\nthem. He crept back onto his throne like a whipped dog, and lay there\\r\\nbitterly bemoaning his defeat.\\n\"But we have not yet found my faithful follower, the Tin Woodman,\" said\\r\\nOzma to Dorothy, \"and without him I do not wish to go away.\"\\n\"Nor I,\" replied Dorothy, quickly. \"Wasn\\'t he in the palace?\"\\n\"He must be there,\" said Billina; \"but I had no clew to guide me in\\r\\nguessing the Tin Woodman, so I must have missed him.\"\\n\"We will go back into the rooms,\" said Dorothy. \"This magic belt, I am\\r\\nsure, will help us to find our dear old friend.\"\\nSo she re-entered the palace, the doors of which still stood open, and\\r\\neveryone followed her except the Nome King, the Queen of Ev and Prince\\r\\nEvring. The mother had taken the little Prince in[Pg 238] her lap and was\\r\\nfondling and kissing him lovingly, for he was her youngest born.\\nBut the others went with Dorothy, and when she came to the middle of the\\r\\nfirst room the girl waved her hand, as she had seen the King do, and\\r\\ncommanded the Tin Woodman, whatever form he might then have, to resume\\r\\nhis proper shape. No result followed this attempt, so Dorothy went into\\r\\nanother room and repeated it, and so through all the rooms of the\\r\\npalace. Yet the Tin Woodman did not appear to them, nor could they\\r\\nimagine which among the thousands of ornaments was their transformed\\r\\nfriend.\\nSadly they returned to the throne room, where the King, seeing that they\\r\\nhad met with failure, jeered at Dorothy, saying:\\n\"You do not know how to use my belt, so it is of no use to you. Give it\\r\\nback to me and I will let you go free—you and all the people who came\\r\\nwith you. As for the royal family of Ev, they are my slaves, and shall\\r\\nremain here.\"\\n\"I shall keep the belt,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"But how can you escape, without my consent?\" asked the King.\\n\"Easily enough,\" answered the girl. \"All we need to do is to walk out\\r\\nthe way that we came in.\"[Pg 239]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY AND BILLINA ARGUE WITH THE KING\\n[Pg 240]\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all, is it?\" sneered the King. \"Well, where is the passage\\r\\nthrough which you entered this room?\"\\nThey all looked around, but could not discover the place, for it had\\r\\nlong since been closed. Dorothy, however, would not be dismayed. She\\r\\nwaved her hand toward the seemingly solid wall of the cavern and said:\\n\"I command the passage to open!\"\\nInstantly the order was obeyed; the opening appeared and the passage lay\\r\\nplainly before them.\\nThe King was amazed, and all the others overjoyed.\\n\"Why, then, if the belt obeys you, were we unable to discover the Tin\\r\\nWoodman?\" asked Ozma.\\n\"I can\\'t imagine,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"See here, girl,\" proposed the King, eagerly; \"give me the belt, and I\\r\\nwill tell you what shape the Tin Woodman was changed into, and then you\\r\\ncan easily find him.\"\\nDorothy hesitated, but Billina cried out:\\n\"Don\\'t you do it! If the Nome King gets the belt again he will make\\r\\nevery one of us prisoners, for we will be in his power. Only by keeping\\r\\nthe belt, Dorothy, will you ever be able to leave this place in\\r\\nsafety.\"[Pg 241]\\n\"I think that is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"But I have another idea,\\r\\ndue to my excellent brains. Let Dorothy transform the King into a\\r\\ngoose-egg unless he agrees to go into the palace and bring out to us the\\r\\nornament which is our friend Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"\\n\"A goose-egg!\" echoed the horrified King. \"How dreadful!\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 242]\\n\"Well, a goose-egg you will be unless you go and fetch us the ornament\\r\\nwe want,\" declared Billina, with a joyful chuckle.\\n\"You can see for yourself that Dorothy is able to use the magic belt all\\r\\nright,\" added the Scarecrow.\\nThe Nome King thought it over and finally consented, for he did not want\\r\\nto be a goose-egg. So he went into the palace to get the ornament which\\r\\nwas the transformation of the Tin Woodman, and they all awaited his\\r\\nreturn with considerable impatience, for they were anxious to leave this\\r\\nunderground cavern and see the sunshine once more. But when the Nome\\r\\nKing came back he brought nothing with him except a puzzled and anxious\\r\\nexpression upon his face.\\n\"He\\'s gone!\" he said. \"The Tin Woodman is nowhere in the palace.\"\\n\"Are you sure?\" asked Ozma, sternly.\\n\"I\\'m very sure,\" answered the King, trembling, \"for I know just what I\\r\\ntransformed him into, and exactly where he stood. But he is not there,\\r\\nand please don\\'t change me into a goose-egg, because I\\'ve done the best\\r\\nI could.\"\\nThey were all silent for a time, and then Dorothy said:\\n\"There is no use punishing the Nome King any[Pg 243] more, and I\\'m \\'fraid we\\'ll\\r\\nhave to go away without our friend.\"\\n\"If he is not here, we cannot rescue him,\" agreed the Scarecrow, sadly.\\r\\n\"Poor Nick! I wonder what has become of him.\"\\n\"And he owed me six weeks back pay!\" said one of the generals, wiping\\r\\nthe tears from his eyes with his gold-laced coat sleeve.\\nVery sorrowfully they determined to return to the upper world without\\r\\ntheir former companion, and so Ozma gave the order to begin the march\\r\\nthrough the passage.\\nThe army went first, and then the royal family of Ev, and afterward came\\r\\nDorothy, Ozma, Billina, the Scarecrow and Tiktok.\\nThey left the Nome King scowling at them from his throne, and had no\\r\\nthought of danger until Ozma chanced to look back and saw a large number\\r\\nof the warriors following them in full chase, with their swords and\\r\\nspears and axes raised to strike down the fugitives as soon as they drew\\r\\nnear enough.\\nEvidently the Nome King had made this last attempt to prevent their\\r\\nescaping him; but it did him no good, for when Dorothy saw the danger\\r\\nthey were in she stopped and waved her hand and whispered a command to\\r\\nthe magic belt.[Pg 244]\\n\\n\\n\\nInstantly the foremost warriors became eggs, which rolled upon the floor\\r\\nof the cavern in such numbers that those behind could not advance\\r\\nwithout stepping upon them. But, when they saw the eggs, all desire to\\r\\nadvance departed from the warriors, and they turned and fled madly into\\r\\nthe cavern, and refused to go back again.\\nOur friends had no farther trouble in reaching the end of the passage,\\r\\nand soon were standing in the outer air upon the gloomy path between\\r\\nthe[Pg 245] two high mountains. But the way to Ev lay plainly before them, and\\r\\nthey fervently hoped that they had seen the last of the Nome King and of\\r\\nhis dreadful palace.\\nThe cavalcade was led by Ozma, mounted on the Cowardly Lion, and the\\r\\nQueen of Ev, who rode upon the back of the Tiger. The children of the\\r\\nQueen walked behind her, hand in hand. Dorothy rode the Sawhorse, while\\r\\nthe Scarecrow walked and commanded the army in the absence of the Tin\\r\\nWoodman.\\nPresently the way began to lighten and more of the sunshine to come in\\r\\nbetween the two mountains. And before long they heard the \"thump! thump!\\r\\nthump!\" of the giant\\'s hammer upon the road.\\n\"How may we pass the monstrous man of iron?\" asked the Queen, anxious\\r\\nfor the safety of her children. But Dorothy solved the problem by a word\\r\\nto the magic belt.\\nThe giant paused, with his hammer held motionless in the air, thus\\r\\nallowing the entire party to pass between his cast-iron legs in safety.[Pg 246]\\n\\nThe King of Ev\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nIf there were any shifting, rock-colored Nomes on the mountain side now,\\r\\nthey were silent and respectful, for our adventurers were not annoyed,\\r\\nas before, by their impudent laughter. Really the Nomes had nothing to\\r\\nlaugh at, since the defeat of their King.\\nOn the other side they found Ozma\\'s golden chariot, standing as they had\\r\\nleft it. Soon the Lion and the Tiger were harnessed to the beautiful\\r\\nchariot, in which was enough room for Ozma and the Queen and six of the\\r\\nroyal children.\\nLittle Evring preferred to ride with Dor[Pg 247]othy upon the Sawhorse, which\\r\\nhad a long back. The Prince had recovered from his shyness and had\\r\\nbecome very fond of the girl who had rescued him, so they were fast\\r\\nfriends and chatted pleasantly together as they rode along. Billina was\\r\\nalso perched upon the head of the wooden steed, which seemed not to mind\\r\\nthe added weight in the least, and the boy was full of wonder that a hen\\r\\ncould talk, and say such sensible things.\\nWhen they came to the gulf, Ozma\\'s magic carpet carried them all over in\\r\\nsafety; and now they began to pass the trees, in which birds were\\r\\nsinging; and the breeze that was wafted to them from the farms of Ev was\\r\\nspicy with flowers and new-mown hay; and the sunshine fell full upon\\r\\nthem, to warm them and drive away from their bodies the chill and\\r\\ndampness of the underground kingdom of the Nomes.\\n\"I would be quite content,\" said the Scarecrow to Tiktok, \"were only the\\r\\nTin Woodman with us. But it breaks my heart to leave him behind.\"\\n\"He was a fine fel-low,\" replied Tiktok, \"al-though his ma-ter-i-al was\\r\\nnot ve-ry du-ra-ble.\"\\n\"Oh, tin is an excellent material,\" the Scarecrow hastened to say; \"and\\r\\nif anything ever happened to poor Nick Chopper he was always easily\\r\\nsoldered.[Pg 248] Besides, he did not have to be wound up, and was not liable\\r\\nto get out of order.\"\\n\\n\"I some-times wish,\" said Tiktok, \"that I was stuffed with straw, as you\\r\\nare. It is hard to be made of cop-per.\"\\n\"I have no reason to complain of my lot,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"A\\r\\nlittle fresh straw, now and then, makes me as good as new. But I can\\r\\nnever be the polished gentleman that my poor departed friend, the Tin\\r\\nWoodman, was.\"\\nYou may be sure the royal children of Ev and their Queen mother were\\r\\ndelighted at seeing again their beloved country; and when the towers of\\r\\nthe palace of Ev came into view they could not forbear cheering at the\\r\\nsight. Little Evring, riding in front of Dorothy, was so overjoyed that\\r\\nhe took a curious tin whistle from his pocket and blew a shrill blast\\r\\nthat made the Sawhorse leap and prance in sudden alarm.\\n\"What is that?\" asked Billina, who had been obliged to flutter her wings\\r\\nin order to keep her seat upon the head of the frightened Sawhorse.\\n\"That\\'s my whistle,\" said Prince Evring, holding it out upon his hand.\\nIt was in the shape of a little fat pig, made of tin and painted green.\\r\\nThe whistle was in the tail of the pig.[Pg 249]\\n\"Where did you get it?\" asked the yellow hen, closely examining the toy\\r\\nwith her bright eyes.\\n\"Why, I picked it up in the Nome King\\'s palace, while Dorothy was making\\r\\nher guesses, and I put it in my pocket,\" answered the little Prince.\\n\\n\\n\\nBillina laughed; or at least she made the peculiar cackle that served\\r\\nher for a laugh.\\n\"No wonder I couldn\\'t find the Tin Woodman,\" she said; \"and no wonder the\\r\\nmagic belt didn\\'t make him appear, or the King couldn\\'t find him,\\r\\neither!\"[Pg 250]\\n\"What do you mean?\" questioned Dorothy.\\n\"Why, the Prince had him in his pocket,\" cried Billina, cackling again.\\n\"I did not!\" protested little Evring. \"I only took the whistle.\"\\n\"Well, then, watch me,\" returned the hen, and reaching out a claw she\\r\\ntouched the whistle and said \"Ev.\"\\nSwish!\\n\"Good afternoon,\" said the Tin Woodman, taking off his funnel cap and\\r\\nbowing to Dorothy and the Prince. \"I think I must have been asleep for\\r\\nthe first time since I was made of tin, for I do not remember our\\r\\nleaving the Nome King.\"\\n\"You have been enchanted,\" answered the girl, throwing an arm around her\\r\\nold friend and hugging him tight in her joy. \"But it\\'s all right, now.\"\\n\"I want my whistle!\" said the little Prince, beginning to cry.\\n\"Hush!\" cautioned Billina. \"The whistle is lost, but you may have\\r\\nanother when you get home.\"\\n\\n\\n\"YOUR FUTURE RULER, KING EVARDO FIFTEENTH\"\\n\\nThe Scarecrow had fairly thrown himself upon the bosom of his old\\r\\ncomrade, so surprised and delighted was he to see him again, and Tiktok\\r\\nsqueezed the Tin Woodman\\'s hand so earnestly that he dented some of his\\r\\nfingers. Then they had to make way[Pg 252][Pg 251] for Ozma to welcome the tin man,\\r\\nand the army caught sight of him and set up a cheer, and everybody was\\r\\ndelighted and happy.\\nFor the Tin Woodman was a great favorite with all who knew him, and his\\r\\nsudden recovery after they had thought he was lost to them forever was\\r\\nindeed a pleasant surprise.\\nBefore long, the cavalcade arrived at the royal palace, where a great\\r\\ncrowd of people had gathered to welcome their Queen and her ten\\r\\nchildren. There was much shouting and cheering, and the people threw\\r\\nflowers in their path, and every face wore a happy smile.\\nThey found the Princess Langwidere in her mirrored chamber, where she\\r\\nwas admiring one of her handsomest heads—one with rich chestnut hair,\\r\\ndreamy walnut eyes and a shapely hickorynut nose. She was very glad to\\r\\nbe relieved of her duties to the people of Ev, and the Queen graciously\\r\\npermitted her to retain her rooms and her cabinet of heads as long as\\r\\nshe lived.\\nThen the Queen took her eldest son out upon a balcony that overlooked\\r\\nthe crowd of subjects gathered below, and said to them:\\n\"Here is your future ruler, King Evardo Fifteenth. He is fifteen years\\r\\nof age, has fifteen silver[Pg 253] buckles on his jacket and is the fifteenth\\r\\nEvardo to rule the land of Ev.\"\\nThe people shouted their approval fifteen times, and even the Wheelers,\\r\\nsome of whom were present, loudly promised to obey the new King.\\nSo the Queen placed a big crown of gold, set with rubies, upon Evardo\\'s\\r\\nhead, and threw an ermine robe over his shoulders, and proclaimed him\\r\\nKing; and he bowed gratefully to all his subjects and then went away to\\r\\nsee if he could find any cake in the royal pantry.\\nOzma of Oz and her people, as well as Dorothy, Tiktok and Billina, were\\r\\nsplendidly entertained by the Queen mother, who owed all her happiness\\r\\nto their kind offices; and that evening the yellow hen was publicly\\r\\npresented with a beautiful necklace of pearls and sapphires, as a token\\r\\nof esteem from the new King.\\n\\n\\n[Pg 254]\\n\\nThe Emerald City\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nDorothy decided to accept Ozma\\'s invitation to return with her to the\\r\\nLand of Oz. There was no greater chance of her getting home from Ev than\\r\\nfrom Oz, and the little girl was anxious to see once more the country\\r\\nwhere she had encountered such wonderful adventures. By this time Uncle\\r\\nHenry would have reached Australia in his ship, and had probably given\\r\\nher up for lost; so he couldn\\'t worry any more than he did if she stayed\\r\\naway from him a while longer. So she would go to Oz.\\nThey bade good-bye to the people of Ev, and the King promised Ozma that\\r\\nhe would ever be[Pg 255] grateful to her and render the Land of Oz any service\\r\\nthat might lie within his power.\\nAnd then they approached the edge of the dangerous desert, and Ozma\\r\\nthrew down the magic carpet, which at once unrolled far enough for all\\r\\nof them to walk upon it without being crowded.\\nTiktok, claiming to be Dorothy\\'s faithful follower because he belonged\\r\\nto her, had been permitted to join the party, and before they started\\r\\nthe girl wound up his machinery as far as possible, and the copper man\\r\\nstepped off as briskly as any one of them.\\nOzma also invited Billina to visit the Land of Oz, and the yellow hen\\r\\nwas glad enough to go where new sights and scenes awaited her.\\nThey began the trip across the desert early in the morning, and as they\\r\\nstopped only long enough for Billina to lay her daily egg, before sunset\\r\\nthey espied the green slopes and wooded hills of the beautiful Land of\\r\\nOz. They entered it in the Munchkin territory, and the King of the\\r\\nMunchkins met them at the border and welcomed Ozma with great respect,\\r\\nbeing very pleased by her safe return. For Ozma of Oz ruled the King of\\r\\nthe Munchkins, the King of the Winkies, the King of the Quadlings and\\r\\nthe King of the Gillikins just as those kings ruled their own people;\\r\\nand this supreme ruler of[Pg 256] the Land of Oz lived in a great town of her\\r\\nown, called the Emerald City, which was in the exact center of the four\\r\\nkingdoms of the Land of Oz.\\n\\nThe Munchkin king entertained them at his palace that night, and in the\\r\\nmorning they set out for the Emerald City, travelling over a road of\\r\\nyellow brick that led straight to the jewel-studded gates. Everywhere\\r\\nthe people turned out to greet their beloved Ozma and to hail joyfully\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, who were popular\\r\\nfavorites. Dorothy, too, remembered some of the people, who had\\r\\nbefriended her on the occasion of her first visit to Oz, and they were\\r\\nwell pleased to see the little Kansas girl again, and showered her with\\r\\ncompliments and good wishes.\\nAt one place, where they stopped to refresh themselves, Ozma accepted a\\r\\nbowl of milk from the hands of a pretty dairy-maid. Then she looked at\\r\\nthe girl more closely, and exclaimed:\\n\"Why, it\\'s Jinjur—isn\\'t it!\"\\n\"Yes, your Highness,\" was the reply, as Jinjur dropped a low curtsy. And\\r\\nDorothy looked wonderingly at this lively appearing person, who had once\\r\\nassembled an army of women and driven the Scarecrow from the throne of\\r\\nthe Emerald City,[Pg 257] and even fought a battle with the powerful army of\\r\\nGlinda the Sorceress.\\n\"I\\'ve married a man who owns nine cows,\" said Jinjur to Ozma, \"and now I\\r\\nam happy and contented and willing to lead a quiet life and mind my own\\r\\nbusiness.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Where is your husband?\" asked Ozma.\\n\"He is in the house, nursing a black eye,\" replied Jinjur, calmly. \"The\\r\\nfoolish man would insist upon milking the red cow when I wanted him to\\r\\nmilk the white one; but he will know better next time, I am sure.\"[Pg 258]\\nThen the party moved on again, and after crossing a broad river on a\\r\\nferry and passing many fine farm houses that were dome shaped and\\r\\npainted a pretty green color, they came in sight of a large building\\r\\nthat was covered with flags and bunting.\\n\"I don\\'t remember that building,\" said Dorothy. \"What is it?\"\\n\"That is the College of Art and Athletic Perfection,\" replied Ozma. \"I\\r\\nhad it built quite recently, and the Woggle-Bug is its president. It\\r\\nkeeps him busy, and the young men who attend the college are no worse\\r\\noff than they were before. You see, in this country are a number of\\r\\nyouths who do not like to work, and the college is an excellent place\\r\\nfor them.\"\\nAnd now they came in sight of the Emerald City, and the people flocked\\r\\nout to greet their lovely ruler. There were several bands and many\\r\\nofficers and officials of the realm, and a crowd of citizens in their\\r\\nholiday attire.\\nThus the beautiful Ozma was escorted by a brilliant procession to her\\r\\nroyal city, and so great was the cheering that she was obliged to\\r\\nconstantly bow to the right and left to acknowledge the greetings of her\\r\\nsubjects.\\n\\n\\n\"I PROMOTE YOU TO BE CAPTAIN-GENERAL\"\\n\\nThat evening there was a grand reception in the[Pg 260][Pg 259] royal palace, attended\\r\\nby the most important persons of Oz, and Jack Pumpkinhead, who was a\\r\\nlittle over-ripe but still active, read an address congratulating Ozma\\r\\nof Oz upon the success of her generous mission to rescue the royal\\r\\nfamily of a neighboring kingdom.\\nThen magnificent gold medals set with precious stones were presented to\\r\\neach of the twenty-six officers; and the Tin Woodman was given a new axe\\r\\nstudded with diamonds; and the Scarecrow received a silver jar of\\r\\ncomplexion powder. Dorothy was presented with a pretty coronet and made\\r\\na Princess of Oz, and Tiktok received two bracelets set with eight rows\\r\\nof very clear and sparkling emeralds.\\nAfterward they sat down to a splendid feast, and Ozma put Dorothy at her\\r\\nright and Billina at her left, where the hen sat upon a golden roost and\\r\\nate from a jeweled platter. Then were placed the Scarecrow, the Tin\\r\\nWoodman and Tiktok, with baskets of lovely flowers before them, because\\r\\nthey did not require food. The twenty-six officers were at the lower end\\r\\nof the table, and the Lion and the Tiger also had seats, and were served\\r\\non golden platters, that held a half a bushel at one time.\\nThe wealthiest and most important citizens of[Pg 261] the Emerald City were\\r\\nproud to wait upon these famous adventurers, and they were assisted by a\\r\\nsprightly little maid named Jellia Jamb, whom the Scarecrow pinched upon\\r\\nher rosy cheeks and seemed to know very well.\\nDuring the feast Ozma grew thoughtful, and suddenly she asked:\\n\"Where is the private?\"\\n\"Oh, he is sweeping out the barracks,\" replied one of the generals, who\\r\\nwas busy eating a leg of a turkey. \"But I have ordered him a dish of\\r\\nbread and molasses to eat when his work is done.\"\\n\"Let him be sent for,\" said the girl ruler.\\nWhile they waited for this command to be obeyed, she enquired:\\n\"Have we any other privates in the armies?\"\\n\"Oh, yes,\" replied the Tin Woodman, \"I believe there are three,\\r\\naltogether.\"\\nThe private now entered, saluting his officers and the royal Ozma very\\r\\nrespectfully.\\n\"What is your name, my man?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Omby Amby,\" answered the private.\\n\"Then, Omby Amby,\" said she, \"I promote you to be Captain General of all\\r\\nthe armies of my kingdom, and especially to be Commander of my Body\\r\\nGuard at the royal palace.\"[Pg 262]\\n\"It is very expensive to hold so many offices,\" said the private,\\r\\nhesitating. \"I have no money with which to buy uniforms.\"\\n\"You shall be supplied from the royal treasury,\" said Ozma.\\nThen the private was given a seat at the table, where the other officers\\r\\nwelcomed him cordially, and the feasting and merriment were resumed.\\nSuddenly Jellia Jamb exclaimed:\\n\"There is nothing more to eat! The Hungry Tiger has consumed\\r\\neverything!\"\\n\"But that is not the worst of it,\" declared the Tiger, mournfully.\\r\\n\"Somewhere or somehow, I\\'ve actually lost my appetite!\"\\n\\n\\n[Pg 263]\\n\\nDorothy\\'s Magic Belt\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nDorothy passed several very happy weeks in the Land of Oz as the guest\\r\\nof the royal Ozma, who delighted to please and interest the little\\r\\nKansas girl. Many new acquaintances were formed and many old ones\\r\\nrenewed, and wherever she went Dorothy found herself among friends.\\nOne day, however, as she sat in Ozma\\'s private room, she noticed hanging\\r\\nupon the wall a picture which constantly changed in appearance, at one\\r\\ntime showing a meadow and at another time a forest, a lake or a\\r\\nvillage.[Pg 264]\\n\"How curious!\" she exclaimed, after watching the shifting scenes for a\\r\\nfew moments.\\n\"Yes,\" said Ozma, \"that is really a wonderful invention in magic. If I\\r\\nwish to see any part of the world or any person living, I need only\\r\\nexpress the wish and it is shown in the picture.\"\\n\"May I use it?\" asked Dorothy, eagerly.\\n\"Of course, my dear.\"\\n\"Then I\\'d like to see the old Kansas farm, and Aunt Em,\" said the girl.\\nInstantly the well remembered farmhouse appeared in the picture, and\\r\\nAunt Em could be seen quite plainly. She was engaged in washing dishes\\r\\nby the kitchen window and seemed quite well and contented. The hired men\\r\\nand the teams were in the harvest fields behind the house, and the corn\\r\\nand wheat seemed to the child to be in prime condition. On the side\\r\\nporch Dorothy\\'s pet dog, Toto, was lying fast asleep in the sun, and to\\r\\nher surprise old Speckles was running around with a brood of twelve new\\r\\nchickens trailing after her.\\n\\n\"Everything seems all right at home,\" said Dorothy, with a sigh of\\r\\nrelief. \"Now I wonder what Uncle Henry is doing.\"\\nThe scene in the picture at once shifted to Australia, where, in a\\r\\npleasant room in Sydney,[Pg 265] Uncle Henry was seated in an easy chair,\\r\\nsolemnly smoking his briar pipe. He looked sad and lonely, and his hair\\r\\nwas now quite white and his hands and face thin and wasted.\\n\"Oh!\" cried Dorothy, in an anxious voice, \"I\\'m sure Uncle Henry isn\\'t\\r\\ngetting any better, and it\\'s because he is worried about me. Ozma, dear,\\r\\nI must go to him at once!\"\\n\"How can you?\" asked Ozma.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" replied Dorothy; \"but let us go to Glinda the Good. I\\'m\\r\\nsure she will help me, and advise me how to get to Uncle Henry.\"\\nOzma readily agreed to this plan and caused the Sawhorse to be harnessed\\r\\nto a pretty green and pink phaeton, and the two girls rode away to visit\\r\\nthe famous sorceress.\\nGlinda received them graciously, and listened to Dorothy\\'s story with\\r\\nattention.\\n\"I have the magic belt, you know,\" said the little girl. \"If I buckled\\r\\nit around my waist and commanded it to take me to Uncle Henry, wouldn\\'t\\r\\nit do it?\"\\n\"I think so,\" replied Glinda, with a smile.\\n\"And then,\" continued Dorothy, \"if I ever wanted to come back here\\r\\nagain, the belt would bring me.\"[Pg 266]\\n\\n\\n\"THAT IS A WISE PLAN,\" REPLIED GLINDA\\n[Pg 267]\\n\"In that you are wrong,\" said the sorceress. \"The belt has magical\\r\\npowers only while it is in some fairy country, such as the Land of Oz,\\r\\nor the Land of Ev. Indeed, my little friend, were you to wear it and\\r\\nwish yourself in Australia, with your uncle, the wish would doubtless be\\r\\nfulfilled, because it was made in fairyland. But you would not find the\\r\\nmagic belt around you when you arrived at your destination.\"\\n\"What would become of it?\" asked the girl.\\n\"It would be lost, as were your silver shoes when you visited Oz before,\\r\\nand no one would ever see it again. It seems too bad to destroy the use\\r\\nof the magic belt in that way, doesn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Then,\" said Dorothy, after a moment\\'s thought, \"I will give the magic\\r\\nbelt to Ozma, for she can use it in her own country. And she can wish me\\r\\ntransported to Uncle Henry without losing the belt.\"\\n\"That is a wise plan,\" replied Glinda.\\nSo they rode back to the Emerald City, and on the way it was arranged\\r\\nthat every Saturday morning Ozma would look at Dorothy in her magic\\r\\npicture, wherever the little girl might chance to be. And, if she saw\\r\\nDorothy make a certain signal, then Ozma would know that the little\\r\\nKansas girl wanted to revisit the Land of Oz, and by means of the Nome[Pg 268]\\r\\nKing\\'s magic belt would wish that she might instantly return.\\nThis having been agreed upon, Dorothy bade good-bye to all her friends.\\r\\nTiktok wanted to go to Australia, too; but Dorothy knew that the machine\\r\\nman would never do for a servant in a civilized country, and the chances\\r\\nwere that his machinery wouldn\\'t work at all. So she left him in Ozma\\'s\\r\\ncare.\\nBillina, on the contrary, preferred the Land of Oz to any other country,\\r\\nand refused to accompany Dorothy.\\n\"The bugs and ants that I find here are the finest flavored in the\\r\\nworld,\" declared the yellow hen, \"and there are plenty of them. So here\\r\\nI shall end my days; and I must say, Dorothy, my dear, that you are very\\r\\nfoolish to go back into that stupid, humdrum world again.\"\\n\"Uncle Henry needs me,\" said Dorothy, simply; and every one except\\r\\nBillina thought it was right that she should go.\\nAll Dorothy\\'s friends of the Land of Oz—both old and new—gathered in a\\r\\ngroup in front of the palace to bid her a sorrowful good-bye and to wish\\r\\nher long life and happiness. After much hand shaking, Dorothy kissed\\r\\nOzma once more, and then[Pg 269] handed her the Nome King\\'s magic belt, saying:\\n\"Now, dear Princess, when I wave my handkerchief, please wish me with\\r\\nUncle Henry. I\\'m aw\\'fly sorry to leave you—and the Scarecrow—and the\\r\\nTin Woodman—and the Cowardly Lion—and Tiktok—and—and everybody—but\\r\\nI do want my Uncle Henry! So good-bye, all of you.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThen the little girl stood on one of the big emeralds which decorated\\r\\nthe courtyard, and after[Pg 270] looking once again at each of her friends,\\r\\nwaved her handkerchief.\\n\\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"I wasn\\'t drowned at all. And I\\'ve come to nurse you\\r\\nand take care of you, Uncle Henry, and you must promise to get well as\\r\\nsoon as poss\\'ble.\"\\nUncle Henry smiled and cuddled his little niece close in his lap.\\n\"I\\'m better already, my darling,\" said he.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBooks by L.

FRANK BAUM\\r\\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDEDICATED TO HARRIET A. B. NEAL.\\n\\nTo My Readers\\nIt\\'s no use; no use at all. The children won\\'t let me stop telling tales\\r\\nof the Land of Oz. I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell\\r\\nthem, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won\\'t allow\\r\\nme. They cry: \"Oz—Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I do but\\r\\nobey their commands?\\nThis is Our Book—mine and the children\\'s. For they have flooded me with\\r\\nthousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried to\\r\\nadopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story.\\nAfter the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy\\r\\nhas become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all love\\r\\nDorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn\\'t a real\\r\\nOz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle and\\r\\ninnocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure.\\nThere were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about\\r\\nthe Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the\\r\\nfirst Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself\\r\\n\"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a\\r\\nballoon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So what\\r\\ncould I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You will\\r\\nfind him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.\\nThere was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible to\\r\\ndo in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy\\'s little\\r\\nblack dog, who has many friends among my readers. But you will see, when\\r\\nyou begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy was\\r\\nin California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him. In\\r\\nthis book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog;\\r\\nbut in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend to\\r\\ntell a good deal about Toto\\'s further history.\\nPrincess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introduced\\r\\nin this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You will\\r\\nalso become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets,\\r\\nand Eureka, the Kitten. I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as\\r\\nshe ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn\\'t brought up properly.\\r\\nDorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows.\\nI believe, my dears, that I am the proudest story-teller that ever\\r\\nlived. Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while I\\r\\nread the tender, loving, appealing letters that come to me in almost\\r\\nevery mail from my little readers. To have pleased you, to have\\r\\ninterested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love,\\r\\nthrough my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to become\\r\\nPresident of the United States. Indeed, I would much rather be your\\r\\nstory-teller, under these conditions, than to be the President. So you\\r\\nhave helped me to fulfill my life\\'s ambition, and I am more grateful to\\r\\nyou, my dears, than I can express in words.\\nI try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimes\\r\\nthere are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get\\r\\nyour answer. But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,\\r\\nand by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of\\r\\npreparing these books. Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the books\\r\\nare partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling the\\r\\nstories, and I am sure they would not be half so good without your\\r\\nclever and thoughtful assistance.\\n\\r\\nL.

It should have arrived at Hugson\\'s\\r\\nsiding at midnight, but it was already five o\\'clock and the gray dawn\\r\\nwas breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the\\r\\nopen shed that served for the station-house. As it came to a stop the\\r\\nconductor called out in a loud voice:\\n\"Hugson\\'s Siding!\"\\nAt once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the\\r\\ncar, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage\\r\\ncovered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked\\r\\nunder her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and then the\\r\\nengineer started his train[Pg 14] again, so that it puffed and groaned and\\r\\nmoved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was because\\r\\nall through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and\\r\\ntrembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the\\r\\nrails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. So he\\r\\nmoved the cars slowly and with caution.\\nThe little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared\\r\\naround a curve; then she turned to see where she was.\\nThe shed at Hugson\\'s Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and\\r\\ndid not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray light\\r\\nnot a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person\\r\\nin sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy\\r\\nstanding near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked toward\\r\\nit and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its\\r\\nhead hanging down almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall and\\r\\nbony, with long legs and large knees and feet. She could count his ribs\\r\\neasily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was\\r\\nlong and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit. His\\r\\ntail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many\\r\\nplaces and fastened together again with[Pg 15] cords and bits of wire. The\\r\\nbuggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains.\\r\\nGetting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw a\\r\\nboy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.\\nShe set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently\\r\\nhe woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly.\\n\"Hello!\" he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"\\n\"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking\\r\\ngray eyes. \"Have you come to take me to Hugson\\'s Ranch?\"\\n\"Of course,\" he answered. \"Train in?\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t be here if it wasn\\'t,\" she said.\\nHe laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out of\\r\\nthe buggy he put Dorothy\\'s suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage on\\r\\nthe floor in front.\\n\"Canary-birds?\" he asked.\\n\"Oh, no; it\\'s just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was the best way to\\r\\ncarry her.\"\\nThe boy nodded.\\n\"Eureka\\'s a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.\\n\"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained. \"Uncle Henry\\r\\nsays \\'Eureka\\' means \\'I have found it.\\'\"[Pg 16]\\n\"All right; hop in.\"\\nShe climbed into the buggy and he followed her. Then the boy picked up\\r\\nthe reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"\\nThe horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his\\r\\ndrooping ears, but that was all.\\n\"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again.\\nThe horse stood still.\\n\"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"\\nThe boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.\\n\"Guess I\\'m half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse. \"But Jim knows\\r\\nhis business all right—don\\'t you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of the\\r\\nanimal.\\nThen he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at\\r\\nonce backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot\\r\\ndown the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.\\n\"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy. \"I\\'ve waited at\\r\\nthat station for five hours.\"\\n\"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy. \"Didn\\'t you feel the ground\\r\\nshake?\"\\n\"Yes; but we\\'re used to such things in California,\" he replied. \"They\\r\\ndon\\'t scare us much.\"[Pg 17]\\n[Pg 18]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY POKED THE BOY WITH HER PARASOL.\\n\\n[Pg 19]\\n\"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.\"\\n\"Did he? Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said,\\r\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horse\\r\\ncontinued to trot with long, regular strides.\\n\"He\\'s pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.\"\\n\"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked.\\n\"Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry\\'s wife\\'s sister; so we\\r\\nmust be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone. \"I work for\\r\\nUncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my\\r\\nboard.\"\\n\"Isn\\'t that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully.\\n\"Why, it\\'s a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I\\'m a splendid\\r\\nworker. I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh.\\n\"What is your name?\" asked Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy\\'s manner\\r\\nand the cheery tone of his voice.\\n\"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed. \"My whole\\r\\nname is Zebediah; but folks just call me \\'Zeb.\\' You\\'ve been to\\r\\nAustralia, haven\\'t you?\"\\n\"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered. \"We got to[Pg 20] San Francisco a week\\r\\nago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson\\'s Ranch for a visit while I\\r\\nstayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.\"\\n\"How long will you be with us?\" he asked.\\n\"Only a day. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.\\r\\nWe\\'ve been away for a long time, you know, and so we\\'re anxious to get\\r\\nhome again.\"\\nThe boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked\\r\\nthoughtful. Then he started to say something to his little companion,\\r\\nbut before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side\\r\\nto side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. Next minute there\\r\\nwas a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground\\r\\nopen in a wide crack and then come together again.\\n\"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat. \"What was\\r\\nthat?\"\\n\"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face. \"It\\r\\nalmost got us that time, Dorothy.\"\\nThe horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Zeb shook the\\r\\nreins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. Then the boy cracked\\r\\nhis whip and touched the animal\\'s flanks with it, and after a low moan\\r\\nof protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.\\nNeither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes.[Pg 21] There was a\\r\\nbreath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would\\r\\nshake violently. Jim\\'s ears were standing erect upon his head and every\\r\\nmuscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home. He was not\\r\\ngoing very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at\\r\\ntimes he would tremble like a leaf.\\nThe sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as\\r\\nit swept over the valley.\\nSuddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into\\r\\nanother great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.\\r\\nWith a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawing\\r\\nthe buggy and its occupants after him.\\nDorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same. The\\r\\nsudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.\\nBlackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they\\r\\nwaited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for\\r\\nthe earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its\\r\\ndreadful depths.\\nThe horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying\\r\\nnoises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the\\r\\nlittle girl lost consciousness. Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but he\\r\\nwas badly frightened, and[Pg 22] clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,\\r\\nexpecting every moment would be his last.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 23]\\n\\nCHAPTER 2.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE GLASS CITY\\nHEN Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so\\r\\nfast. The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an\\r\\numbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated\\r\\ndownward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear.\\r\\nThe worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great\\r\\ncrack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about to\\r\\novertake them at any moment. Crash after crash echoed far above their\\r\\nheads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones and\\r\\nchunks of clay rattled around them on every side. These they could not\\r\\nsee, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamed\\r\\nalmost like a human[Pg 24] being when a stone overtook him and struck his\\r\\nboney body. They did not really hurt the poor horse, because everything\\r\\nwas falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the\\r\\nhorse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, so\\r\\nthat the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he was\\r\\ninjured.\\nHow long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,\\r\\nshe was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, as she stared ahead into\\r\\nthe black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form of\\r\\nthe horse Jim—his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legs\\r\\nsprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turning\\r\\nher head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until\\r\\nnow remained as still and silent as she herself.\\nDorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier. She began to realize\\r\\nthat death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely\\r\\nstarted upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and\\r\\nunusual as were those she had before encountered.\\nWith this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over\\r\\nthe side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.\\r\\nFar below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.\\r\\nThe central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.\\r\\nAround it were[Pg 25] arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five\\r\\nbrilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one\\r\\nblue and one orange. This splendid group of colored suns sent rays\\r\\ndarting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy—with Dorothy and\\r\\nZeb—sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays\\r\\nbegan to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more\\r\\nand more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly\\r\\nilluminated.\\nDorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim\\'s big ears\\r\\nturn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail should\\r\\nbe yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of\\r\\na zebra. Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair was\\r\\npink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.\\n\"Isn\\'t it funny?\" she said.\\nThe boy was startled and his eyes were big. Dorothy had a green streak\\r\\nthrough the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came\\r\\ntogether, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.\\n\"I—I don\\'t s-s-see any-thing funny—\\'bout it!\" he stammered.[Pg 26]\\n\\n\\nHORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.\\n\\nJust then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the\\r\\nhorse tipping also. But they continued to fall,[Pg 27] all together, and the\\r\\nboy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they\\r\\nwere before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll\\r\\nslowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jim\\r\\nstruggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding\\r\\nhimself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of\\r\\nvoice:\\n\"Well, that\\'s better!\"\\nDorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.\\n\"Can your horse talk?\" she asked.\\n\"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy.\\n\"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who had\\r\\noverheard them, \"and I can\\'t explain why I happened to speak then. This\\r\\nis a nice scrape you\\'ve got me into, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,\\r\\ncheerfully. \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.\"\\n\"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry it\\r\\nhappened.\"\\nZeb gave a shiver. All this was so terrible and unreal that he could not\\r\\nunderstand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.\\nSwiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and[Pg 28] passed close\\r\\nbeside them. The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,\\r\\nand they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.\\r\\nThere was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had\\r\\npassed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing\\r\\nrays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.\\n\"We\\'ve got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep\\r\\nsigh. \"We can\\'t keep falling forever, you know.\"\\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"We are somewhere in the middle of the\\r\\nearth, and the chances are we\\'ll reach the other side of it before long.\\r\\nBut it\\'s a big hollow, isn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Awful big!\" answered the boy.\\n\"We\\'re coming to something now,\" announced the horse.\\nAt this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked\\r\\ndown. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either.\\r\\nBut they were floating very, very slowly—so slowly that it could no\\r\\nlonger be called a fall—and the children had ample time to take heart\\r\\nand look about them.\\nThey saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very\\r\\nlike those upon the earth\\'s surface; but all the scene was splendidly\\r\\ncolored by the variegated lights from the six suns. Here and there were\\r\\ngroups of houses[Pg 29] that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkled\\r\\nso brightly.\\n\"I\\'m sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice. \"We are\\r\\nfalling so slowly that we can\\'t be dashed to pieces when we land, and\\r\\nthis country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.\"\\n\"We\\'ll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m not so sure of that,\" replied the girl. \"But don\\'t let us worry\\r\\nover such things, Zeb; we can\\'t help ourselves just now, you know, and\\r\\nI\\'ve always been told it\\'s foolish to borrow trouble.\"\\nThe boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon\\r\\nboth were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out\\r\\nbelow them. They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big\\r\\ncity which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointed\\r\\nspires. These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbled\\r\\nupon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury.\\nJim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight\\r\\nup with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense. But\\r\\nno; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stop\\r\\nat last.\\nWhen Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor[Pg 30] beast\\'s legs\\r\\ntrembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped out\\r\\nof the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he kicked\\r\\nover Dorothy\\'s birdcage, which rolled out upon the roof so that the\\r\\nbottom came off. At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, sat\\r\\ndown upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes.\\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"There\\'s Eureka.\"\\n\"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb.\\n\"Eureka isn\\'t pink; she\\'s white. It\\'s this queer light that gives her\\r\\nthat color.\"\\n\"Where\\'s my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy\\'s face.\\r\\n\"I\\'m \\'most starved to death.\"\\n\"Oh, Eureka! Can you talk?\"\\n\"Talk! Am I talking? Good gracious, I believe I am. Isn\\'t it funny?\"\\r\\nasked the kitten.\\n\"It\\'s all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely. \"Animals ought not to talk. But\\r\\neven old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.\"\\n\"I can\\'t see that it\\'s wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones. \"At\\r\\nleast, it isn\\'t as wrong as some other things. What\\'s going to become of\\r\\nus now?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously.[Pg 31]\\nThe houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent\\r\\nthat one could look through the walls as easily as though a window.\\r\\nDorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used\\r\\nfor rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queer\\r\\nforms huddled into the corners of these rooms.\\nThe roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of\\r\\nglass were lying scattered in every direction. A near by steeple had\\r\\nbeen broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it. Other\\r\\nbuildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;\\r\\nbut they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had\\r\\nhappened to mar their perfection. The rainbow tints from the colored\\r\\nsuns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many\\r\\ndelicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.\\nBut not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had\\r\\narrived, except that of their own voices. They began to wonder if there\\r\\nwere no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world.\\nSuddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they\\r\\nwere on and stepped into plain view. He was not a very large man, but\\r\\nwas well formed and had a beautiful face—calm and serene as the face of\\r\\na fine portrait. His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously[Pg 32]\\r\\ncolored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeams\\r\\ntouched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.\\nThe man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed\\r\\nthe presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly. There was\\r\\nno expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he\\r\\nmust have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had rested\\r\\nupon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly to\\r\\nthe furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his shoulder to\\r\\ngaze at the strange animal.\\n\"Look out!\" cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not\\r\\nlook where he was going; \"be careful, or you\\'ll fall off!\"\\nBut he paid no attention to her warning. He reached the edge of the tall\\r\\nroof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmly\\r\\nas if he were on firm ground.\\nThe girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, and\\r\\nsaw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground. Soon he\\r\\nreached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one of\\r\\nthe glass buildings.\\n\"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.\\n\"Yes; but it\\'s lots of fun, if it is strange,\" remarked the[Pg 33] small\\r\\nvoice of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the\\r\\nair a foot or so away from the edge of the roof.\\n\"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you\\'ll certainly be\\r\\nkilled.\"\\n\"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked around\\r\\nin a circle and then came back to the roof; \"but I can\\'t lose even one\\r\\nof them by falling in this country, because I really couldn\\'t manage to\\r\\nfall if I wanted to.\"\\n\"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Of course; can\\'t you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the air\\r\\nand back to the edge of the roof.\\n\"It\\'s wonderful!\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to help\\r\\nus,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at these\\r\\nstrange happenings.\\n\"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl.\\nZeb drew back with a shiver.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t dare try,\" he said.\\n\"May be Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse.\\n\"And may be he won\\'t!\" answered Jim. \"I\\'ve tumbled through the air long\\r\\nenough to make me contented on this roof.\"[Pg 34]\\n\"But we didn\\'t tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time we\\r\\nreached here we were floating very slowly, and I\\'m almost sure we could\\r\\nfloat down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the air\\r\\nall right.\"\\n\"Eureka weighs only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in a\\r\\nscornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton.\"\\n\"You don\\'t weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,\\r\\nshaking her head as she looked at the animal. \"You\\'re dreadfully\\r\\nskinny.\"\\n\"Oh, well; I\\'m old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently, \"and\\r\\nI\\'ve had lots of trouble in my day, little one. For a good many years I\\r\\ndrew a public cab in Chicago, and that\\'s enough to make anyone skinny.\"\\n\"He eats enough to get fat, I\\'m sure,\" said the boy, gravely.\\n\"Do I? Can you remember any breakfast that I\\'ve had today?\" growled Jim,\\r\\nas if he resented Zeb\\'s speech.\\n\"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of danger\\r\\nlike this it\\'s foolish to talk about eating.\"\\n\"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the horse,\\r\\nwith a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at present no\\r\\none can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not. If\\r\\nthere are, they are liable to be glass oats!\"[Pg 35]\\n\\n\\n\"COME ON, JIM! IT\\'S ALL RIGHT.\"\\n\\n[Pg 36]\\n\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I can see plenty of nice gardens and\\r\\nfields down below us, at the edge of this city. But I wish we could find\\r\\na way to get to the ground.\"[Pg 37]\\n\"Why don\\'t you walk down?\" asked Eureka. \"I\\'m as hungry as the horse is,\\r\\nand I want my milk.\"\\n\"Will you try it, Zeb\" asked the girl, turning to her companion.\\nZeb hesitated. He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadful\\r\\nadventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried. But he did not\\r\\nwish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly to the\\r\\nedge of the roof.\\nDorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it\\r\\nrest in the air a little over the edge of the roof. It seemed firm\\r\\nenough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot.\\r\\nDorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were both\\r\\nwalking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them.\\n\"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy. \"It\\'s all right.\"\\nJim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a sensible\\r\\nhorse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could go where\\r\\nthe others did. So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his short\\r\\ntail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floating\\r\\ndownward to the street. His great weight made him fall faster than the[Pg 38]\\r\\nchildren walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when he came to\\r\\nthe glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not even\\r\\njarred.\\n\"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strange\\r\\ncountry this is.\"\\nPeople began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals,\\r\\nand pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled. There were men and women,\\r\\nbut no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully formed and\\r\\nattractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces. There was not\\r\\nan ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleased\\r\\nby the appearance of these people because their features had no more\\r\\nexpression than the faces of dolls. They did not smile nor did they\\r\\nfrown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness.\\r\\nThey simply stared at the strangers, paying most attention to Jim and\\r\\nEureka, for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and the\\r\\nchildren bore an outward resemblance to themselves.\\nPretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the\\r\\ndark hair just over his forehead. He seemed to be a person of authority,\\r\\nfor the others pressed back to give him room. After turning his composed\\r\\neyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb,\\r\\nwho was a little taller than Dorothy:[Pg 39]\\n\"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones?\"\\nFor a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question. Then,\\r\\nremembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them long\\r\\nbefore they had reached this place, he answered:\\n\"No, sir; we didn\\'t cause anything. It was the earthquake.\"\\nThe man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this\\r\\nspeech. Then he asked:\\n\"What is an earthquake?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused. But Dorothy, seeing\\r\\nhis perplexity, answered:\\n\"It\\'s a shaking of the earth. In this quake a big crack opened and we\\r\\nfell through—horse and buggy, and all—and the stones got loose and\\r\\ncame down with us.\"\\nThe man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes.\\n\"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and we\\r\\nshall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence.\"\\n\"How can we do that?\" asked the girl.\\n\"That I am not prepared to say. It is your affair, not[Pg 40] mine. You must\\r\\ngo to the House of the Sorcerer, who will soon discover the truth.\"\\n\"Where is the House of the Sorcerer?\" the girl enquired.\\n\"I will lead you to it. Come!\"\\nHe turned and walked down the street, and after a moment\\'s hesitation\\r\\nDorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy. The boy\\r\\ntook his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap, Jim.\"\\nAs the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass\\r\\ncity made way for them and formed a procession in their rear. Slowly\\r\\nthey moved down one street and up another, turning first this way and\\r\\nthen that, until they came to an open square in the center of which was\\r\\na big glass palace having a central dome and four tall spires on each\\r\\ncorner.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 41]\\n\\nCHAPTER 3.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE ARRIVAL OF THE WIZARD\\nHE doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and\\r\\nbuggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children found\\r\\nthemselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful. The people at once\\r\\nfollowed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,\\r\\nleaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the\\r\\ncenter of the hall.\\n\"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice.\\nInstantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then it\\r\\nslowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personage\\r\\nseated upon a glass throne just before Jim\\'s nose. He was formed just as\\r\\nwere the other inhabitants of this land[Pg 42] and his clothing only differed\\r\\nfrom theirs in being bright yellow. But he had no hair at all, and all\\r\\nover his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp\\r\\nthorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes. There was even a\\r\\nthorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothy\\r\\nlaughed when she saw him.\\nThe Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl with\\r\\ncold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant.\\n\"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded\\r\\nLand of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly.\\n\"\\'Cause we couldn\\'t help it,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack and\\r\\nbreak our houses?\" he continued.\\n\"We didn\\'t,\" declared the girl.\\n\"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer.\\n\"We don\\'t have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly. \"If you had\\r\\nany sense at all you\\'d known it was the earthquake.\"\\n\"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which did\\r\\nmuch damage and injured some of our people. Today came another Rain of\\r\\nStones, and soon after it you appeared among us.\"[Pg 43]\\n\"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at the\\r\\nSorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rain\\r\\nof Stones. Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first.\\r\\nWhat is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth?\"\\n\"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man. \"I\\r\\nsaid there would be but one Rain of Stones. This second one was a Rain\\r\\nof People-and-Horse-and-Buggy. And some stones came with them.\"\\n\"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star.\\n\"No, my Prince.\"\\n\"Neither stones nor people?\"\\n\"No, my Prince.\"\\n\"Are you sure?\"\\n\"Quite sure, my Prince. My sorcery tells me so.\"\\nJust then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince\\r\\nafter making a low bow.\\n\"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he.\\nImmediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hall\\r\\ninto the street, that they might see what was about to happen. Dorothy\\r\\nand Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcerer\\r\\nremained calmly in his throne.[Pg 44]\\nFar up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon. It was not\\r\\nso high as the glowing star of the six colored suns, but was descending\\r\\nslowly through the air—so slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to\\r\\nmove.\\nThe throng stood still and waited. It was all they could do, for to go\\r\\naway and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurry\\r\\nits fall in any way. The earth children were not noticed, being so near\\r\\nthe average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in the\\r\\nHouse of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the\\r\\nbuggy.\\nGradually the balloon grew bigger, which was proof that it was settling\\r\\ndown upon the Land of the Mangaboos. Dorothy was surprised to find how\\r\\npatient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidly\\r\\nwith excitement. A balloon meant to her some other arrival from the\\r\\nsurface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assist\\r\\nher and Zeb out of their difficulties.\\nIn an hour the balloon had come near enough for her to see a basket\\r\\nsuspended below it; in two hours she could see a head looking over the\\r\\nside of the basket; in three hours the big balloon settled slowly into\\r\\nthe great square in which they stood and came to rest on the glass\\r\\npavement.\\nThen a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his[Pg 45] tall hat, and\\r\\nbowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him. He was quite\\r\\nan old little man, and his head was long and entirely bald.\\n\"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it\\'s Oz!\"\\nThe little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she\\r\\nwas. But he smiled and bowed as he answered:\\n\"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Eh? And you are little\\r\\nDorothy, from Kansas. I remember you very well.\"\\n\"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl.\\n\"It\\'s the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Haven\\'t you heard of him?\"\\nJust then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard.\\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"\\n\"Didn\\'t know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with a\\r\\npleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn\\'t mean to visit you when I\\r\\nstarted out. I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far better\\r\\nthan living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and when I\\r\\ncame down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an earthquake.\\r\\nI had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise[Pg 46] again,\\r\\nand in a few minutes the earth closed over my head. So I continued to\\r\\ndescend until I reached this place, and if you will show me a way to get\\r\\nout of it, I\\'ll go with pleasure. Sorry to have troubled you; but it\\r\\ncouldn\\'t be helped.\"\\nThe Prince had listened with attention. Said he:\\n\"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, called\\r\\nyou a Wizard. Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer?\"\\n\"It\\'s better,\" replied Oz, promptly. \"One Wizard is worth three\\r\\nSorcerers.\"\\n\"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince. \"We Mangaboos have, at the\\r\\npresent time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was picked\\r\\nfrom a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes. Do you ever make\\r\\nmistakes?\"\\n\"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly.\\n\"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in the\\r\\nmarvelous Land of Oz.\"\\n\"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red—although just then a ray\\r\\nof violet sunlight was on his round face.\\n\"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him. \"I wish you to meet our\\r\\nSorcerer.\"\\nThe Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse to\\r\\naccept it. So he followed the Prince into the great[Pg 47] domed hall, and\\r\\nDorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped in\\r\\nalso.\\nThere sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the Wizard\\r\\nsaw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles.\\n\"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed.\\n\"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is an\\r\\nexcellent Sorcerer. The only fault I find with him is that he is so\\r\\noften wrong.\"\\n\"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer.\\n\"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stones\\r\\nor of People,\" said the Prince.\\n\"Well, what then?\"\\n\"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong.\"\\n\"One person cannot be called \\'people,\\'\" said the Sorcerer. \"If two\\r\\nshould come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; but\\r\\nunless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right.\"\\n\"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased. \"I am\\r\\ndelighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of\\r\\nit. Were you ever with a circus, brother?\"\\n\"No,\" said the Sorcerer.[Pg 48]\\n\"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously. \"I belong to\\r\\nBailum & Barney\\'s Great Consolidated Shows—three rings in one tent and\\r\\na menagerie on the side. It\\'s a fine aggregation, I assure you.\"\\n\"What do you do?\" asked the Sorcerer.\\n\"I go up in a balloon, usually, to draw the crowds to the circus. But\\r\\nI\\'ve just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid earth,\\r\\nand land lower down than I intended. But never mind. It isn\\'t everybody\\r\\nwho gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos.\"\\n\"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him. \"If you are a Wizard you\\r\\nought to be able to call people by their right names.\"\\n\"Oh, I\\'m a Wizard; you may be sure of that. Just as good a Wizard as you\\r\\nare a Sorcerer.\"\\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said the other.\\n\"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to the\\r\\nlittle man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain.\\r\\nOtherwise—\"\\n\"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard.\\n\"I will stop you from living, and forbid you to be planted,\" returned\\r\\nthe Prince.\\n\"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little[Pg 49] man, looking\\r\\nat the one with the star uneasily. \"But never mind. I\\'ll beat Old\\r\\nPrickly, all right.\"\\n\"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyes\\r\\nupon his rival. \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about to\\r\\nperform.\"\\nHe waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,\\r\\nplaying sweet music. Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could discover\\r\\nno bells at all in the great glass hall.\\nThe Mangaboo people listened, but showed no great interest. It was one\\r\\nof the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer.\\nNow was the Wizard\\'s turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:\\n\"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"\\nNo one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had lost\\r\\nhis, somehow, in his flight through the air.\\n\"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief?\"\\nBut they had no handkerchiefs, either.\\n\"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard. \"I\\'ll use my own hat, if you please.\\r\\nNow, good people, observe me carefully. You see, there is nothing up my\\r\\nsleeve and nothing concealed about my person. Also, my hat is quite\\r\\nempty.\" He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking it\\r\\nbriskly.[Pg 50]\\n\"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer.\\nHe took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to the\\r\\nWizard.\\n\"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing.\"\\nHe placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and\\r\\nthen removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a\\r\\nmouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal\\r\\nin a tiny, shrill voice.\\nThe people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,\\r\\nbig or little. The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in his\\r\\nhand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail\\r\\nbetween the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the two\\r\\nparts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant.\\nHe placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulled\\r\\napart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these was\\r\\npulled apart, making four piglets. The Wizard continued this surprising\\r\\nperformance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet, all\\r\\nsquealing and grunting in a very comical way.\\n\"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, I\\r\\nwill make something nothing again.\"\\nWith this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed[Pg 51] them together, so\\r\\nthat the two were one. Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it\\r\\ninto the first, where it disappeared. And so, one by one, the nine tiny\\r\\npiglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creatures\\r\\nremained. This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mystic\\r\\nsign above it. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared\\r\\nentirely.\\nThe little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him, and\\r\\nthen the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:\\n\"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater than\\r\\nthose of my Sorcerer.\"\\n\"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig.\\n\"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard.\\n\"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply. \"I perceive\\r\\nthat you are curiously constructed, and that if you cannot breathe you\\r\\ncannot keep alive.\"\\nThe little man looked troubled.\\n\"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked.\\n\"About five minutes. I\\'m going to begin now. Watch me carefully.\"\\nHe began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the little\\r\\nman did not watch him long. Instead, he drew a leathern case from his\\r\\npocket and took from it several sharp knives, which he joined together,\\r\\none after another,[Pg 52] until they made a long sword. By the time he had\\r\\nattached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe,\\r\\nas the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect.\\nSo the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the sharp\\r\\nsword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a mighty\\r\\nstroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two.\\nDorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the two\\r\\nhalves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had no\\r\\nbones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was cut\\r\\nlooked much like a sliced turnip or potato.\\n\"Why, he\\'s vegetable!\" cried the Wizard, astonished.\\n\"Of course,\" said the Prince. \"We are all vegetable, in this country.\\r\\nAre you not vegetable, also?\"\\n\"No,\" answered the Wizard. \"People on top of the earth are all meat.\\r\\nWill your Sorcerer die?\"\\n\"Certainly, sir. He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly. So\\r\\nwe must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush,\"\\r\\ncontinued the Prince.\\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled.\\n\"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince, \"I\\r\\nwill explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of our\\r\\nVegetable Kingdom.\"[Pg 53]\\n\\n\\nTHE WIZARD CUT THE SORCERER EXACTLY IN TWO.\\n\\n[Pg 54]\\n\\n[Pg 55]\\nCHAPTER 4.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE VEGETABLE KINGDOM\\nFTER the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken it\\r\\napart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man with\\r\\nthe star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of the\\r\\nSorcerer to the public gardens.\\nJim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,\\r\\nand wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper to\\r\\neat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ride\\r\\nwith them. The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the two\\r\\nchildren, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped upon\\r\\nhis back and sat there quite contentedly.[Pg 56]\\nSo the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the Sorcerer\\r\\nfirst, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangers\\r\\ninside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no hearts\\r\\nand could neither smile nor frown.\\nThe glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people lived\\r\\nthere; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a\\r\\nbroad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that\\r\\nflowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over some\\r\\nof the brooks were ornamental glass bridges.\\nDorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,\\r\\nso that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better.\\n\"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl.\\n\"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star. \"They grow.\"\\n\"That\\'s queer,\" said she. \"Did the glass houses in your city grow, too?\"\\n\"Of course,\" he replied. \"But it took a good many years for them to grow\\r\\nas large and fine as they are now. That is why we are so angry when a\\r\\nRain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs.\"\\n\"Can\\'t you mend them?\" she enquired.[Pg 57]\\n\"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait until\\r\\nthey do.\"\\nThey first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grew\\r\\nnearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowers\\r\\nthey were, because the colors were constantly changing under the\\r\\nshifting lights of the six suns. A flower would be pink one second,\\r\\nwhite the next, then blue or yellow; and it was the same way when they\\r\\ncame to the plants, which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground.\\nWhen they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched down\\r\\nhis head and began to nibble.\\n\"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has to\\r\\neat pink grass!\"\\n\"It\\'s violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy.\\n\"Now it\\'s blue,\" complained the horse. \"As a matter of fact, I\\'m eating\\r\\nrainbow grass.\"\\n\"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard.\\n\"Not bad at all,\" said Jim. \"If they give me plenty of it I\\'ll not\\r\\ncomplain about its color.\"\\nBy this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and the\\r\\nPrince said to Dorothy:\\n\"This is our planting-ground.\"\\nSeveral Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and[Pg 58] dug a hole in the\\r\\nground. Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and covered\\r\\nhim up. After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkled\\r\\nthe earth.\\n\"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a large\\r\\nbush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good\\r\\nsorcerers.\"\\n\"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy.\\n\"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"Do not all people grow upon bushes where\\r\\nyou came from, on the outside of the earth.\"\\n\"Not that I ever heard of.\"\\n\"How strange! But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens I\\r\\nwill show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\"\\nIt appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk through\\r\\nthe air with ease, usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way.\\r\\nThere were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,\\r\\nbut on a level surface they generally walked just as we do.\\nThe little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few more\\r\\nof the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a garden\\r\\nenclosed by a high hedge. Jim had refused to leave the field of grass,\\r\\nwhere he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of the\\r\\nbuggy and[Pg 59] joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely at\\r\\ntheir heels.\\nInside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome\\r\\nplants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly\\r\\nreached the ground. In the center of each plant grew a daintily dressed\\r\\nMangaboo, for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon them and was\\r\\nattached to their bodies.\\nThe growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had just\\r\\nturned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman.\\r\\nOn some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, a\\r\\nhalf-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck were\\r\\nmotionless and silent, as if devoid of life. This sight explained to\\r\\nDorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing she\\r\\nhad until now been unable to account for.\\n\"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their\\r\\nbushes,\" said the Prince. \"You will notice they are all attached to the\\r\\nplants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe they are\\r\\neasily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motion\\r\\nand speech. So while they grow they cannot be said to really live, and\\r\\nthey must be picked before they can become good citizens.\"[Pg 60]\\n\"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied. \"If we\\r\\nkeep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for five\\r\\nyears. I\\'ve been picked over six years, but our family is known to be\\r\\nespecially long lived.\"\\n\"Do you eat?\" asked the boy.\\n\"Eat! No, indeed. We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no need\\r\\nto eat, any more than does a potato.\"\\n\"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb.\\n\"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered a\\r\\ngreat misfortune, for then we must be planted at once.\"\\n\"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard.\\n\"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please.\"\\nHe led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew one\\r\\nlarge and beautiful bush.\\n\"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos. All of our Princes\\r\\nand Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial.\"\\nThey stood before it in silent admiration. On the central stalk stood\\r\\npoised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so\\r\\nlovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought\\r\\nshe had never seen so sweet[Pg 61] and adorable a creature in all her life.\\r\\nThe maiden\\'s gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,\\r\\nwhile dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves. Her\\r\\nflesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed\\r\\nboth dignity and grace.\\n\"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously.\\nThe Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush. Now he\\r\\nanswered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:\\n\"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a Royal\\r\\nPrincess. When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty of\\r\\nthe Mangaboos to her.\"\\n\"Isn\\'t she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy.\\nHe hesitated.\\n\"Not quite,\" said he, finally. \"It will be several days before she needs\\r\\nto be picked, or at least that is my judgment. I am in no hurry to\\r\\nresign my office and be planted, you may be sure.\"\\n\"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding.\\n\"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"\\r\\ncontinued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full prime\\r\\nwe must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout\\r\\nand grow and give birth to other people.\"[Pg 62]\\n\"I\\'m sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazing\\r\\nhard at the beautiful girl on the bush. \"She\\'s as perfect as she can\\r\\nbe.\"\\n\"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for a\\r\\nfew days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of\\r\\nyou strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended\\r\\nto at once.\"\\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb.\\n\"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply. \"I\\r\\nthink I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,\\r\\nfor he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us. But the rest of you\\r\\nmust be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I do\\r\\nnot wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.\"\\n\"You needn\\'t worry,\" said Dorothy. \"We wouldn\\'t grow under ground, I\\'m\\r\\nsure.\"\\n\"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard. \"Why not let them\\r\\nlive?\"\\n\"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince. \"They have no right to\\r\\nbe inside the earth at all.\"\\n\"We didn\\'t ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly.[Pg 63]\\nThe children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed.\\r\\nEureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:\\n\"He won\\'t need to destroy me, for if I don\\'t get something to eat\\r\\npretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble.\"\\n\"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard.\\n\"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said the\\r\\nboy.\\n\"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn\\'t touch the nasty things!\"\\n\"You don\\'t need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough now\\r\\nto eat any kind of food.\"\\n\"If I can get it,\" added Eureka.\\n\"I\\'m hungry myself,\" said Zeb. \"But I noticed some strawberries growing\\r\\nin one of the gardens, and some melons in another place. These people\\r\\ndon\\'t eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us get\\r\\nthem.\"\\n\"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince. \"I shall order you\\r\\ndestroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our pretty\\r\\nmelon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\"[Pg 64]\\n\\nCHAPTER 5.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsDOROTHY PICKS THE PRINCESS\\nHE words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not very\\r\\ncomforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure.\\r\\nThe children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him when\\r\\nthe Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder.\\n\"Wait!\" he whispered.\\n\"What for?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard. \"I\\'m quite sure\\r\\nshe\\'s ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, and\\r\\nmay treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to.\"\\n\"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly. \"Let\\'s pick her while we have\\r\\nthe chance, before the man with the star comes back.\"[Pg 65]\\nSo together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one\\r\\nhand of the lovely Princess.\\n\"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward\\r\\nthem and the stems snapped and separated from her feet. She was not at\\r\\nall heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the\\r\\nground.\\nThe beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tucked\\r\\nin a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a look\\r\\naround the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweet\\r\\nbut even toned voice:\\n\"I thank you very much.\"\\n\"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissing\\r\\nher hand.\\nJust then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten,\\r\\nand a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number of\\r\\nhis people.\\nInstantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that she\\r\\nwas picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble.\\n\"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged me\\r\\ngreatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers\\r\\ncome to my rescue. I have been ready for picking all the past week, but\\r\\nbecause you were[Pg 66] selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule,\\r\\nyou left me to stand silent upon my bush.\"\\n\"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a low\\r\\nvoice.\\n\"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" she commanded.\\nSlowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon\\r\\nthat of the Princess. Then all the people bowed low to her, and the\\r\\nPrince turned and walked away alone. What became of him afterward our\\r\\nfriends never knew.\\nThe people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and\\r\\nmarched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace\\r\\nand to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion. But while the\\r\\npeople in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in\\r\\nthe air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior being\\r\\nand more exalted than her subjects.\\nNo one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy and\\r\\nZeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves\\r\\ninto the vegetable gardens. They did not bother to cross the bridges\\r\\nover the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high and\\r\\nwalked in the air to the other side. This was a very interesting\\r\\nexperience to them, and Dorothy said:[Pg 67]\\n\"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.\"\\n\"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to the\\r\\ncenter of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight.\\r\\nBut I\\'ve noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries.\"\\n\"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy.\\n\"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy, promptly. \"Only a fairy country\\r\\ncould have veg\\'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eureka\\r\\nand Jim talk as we do.\"\\n\"That\\'s true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully.\\nIn the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, and\\r\\nseveral other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.\\r\\nBut the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, and\\r\\ncalled the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by\\r\\nmeans of his magical arts.\\nAs they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,\\r\\nEureka said:\\n\"I don\\'t believe you are a Wizard at all!\"\\n\"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right. In the strict sense\\r\\nof the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug.\"[Pg 68]\\n\"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy. \"I\\'ve known\\r\\nhim for a long time.\"\\n\"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trick\\r\\nwith the nine tiny piglets?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug.\"\\n\"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her. \"It was necessary to\\r\\ndeceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupid\\r\\npeople; but I don\\'t mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thing\\r\\nwas only a trick.\"\\n\"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb.\\n\"So did I,\" purred the kitten.\\n\"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard. \"You saw them because they were\\r\\nthere. They are in my inside pocket now. But the pulling of them apart\\r\\nand pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.\"\\n\"Let\\'s see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly.\\nThe little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny\\r\\npiglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around\\r\\nand nibbled the tender blades.\\n\"They\\'re hungry, too,\" he said.\\n\"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and petting\\r\\nit.[Pg 69]\\n\"Be careful!\" said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you\\'re squeezing me!\"\\n\"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment.\\r\\n\"They can actually talk!\"\\n\"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice. \"I\\'m\\r\\nawfully hungry.\"\\n\"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question! It\\r\\nwould be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"\\n\"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at\\r\\nthe kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"\\n\"I\\'m not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I\\'m just hungry.\"\\n\"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared the\\r\\nlittle man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to prove\\r\\nI\\'m a wizard.\"\\n\"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw such\\r\\nsmall pigs before.\"\\n\"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where\\r\\neverything is small because it\\'s a small island. A sailor brought them\\r\\nto Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"\\n\"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of\\r\\nDorothy and looking pleadingly into her face.[Pg 70] \"There are no cows here\\r\\nto give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers. And if I can\\'t eat the\\r\\npiglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"\\n\"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these\\r\\nbrooks. Do you like fish?\"[Pg 71]\\n\"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? Why, they\\'re better than\\r\\npiglets—or even milk!\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll try to catch you some,\" said he.\\n\"But won\\'t they be veg\\'table, like everything else here?\" asked the\\r\\nkitten.\\n\"I think not. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold[Pg 72] and moist as\\r\\nthe vegetables themselves. There is no reason, that I can see, why they\\r\\nmay not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"\\nThen the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string\\r\\nfrom his pocket for a fish-line. The only bait he could find was a\\r\\nbright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool if\\r\\nanything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the\\r\\nblossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby\\r\\nbrook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was\\r\\ncaught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure\\r\\nenough, the fish came with it and was landed[Pg 73] safely on the shore,\\r\\nwhere it began to flop around in great excitement.\\n\\n\\nIN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.\\n\\nThe fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully\\r\\ncut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it\\r\\nclosely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in\\r\\na few moments it had entirely disappeared.\\n\"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"\\n\"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as it\\r\\nwashed its face after the meal. \"But I don\\'t think that fish had any\\r\\nbones, because I didn\\'t feel them scratch my throat.\"\\n\"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.\\n\"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.\\nThe little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with\\r\\nfrightened eyes.\\n\"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.\\n\"I\\'m glad we are not fishes!\" said another.\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I\\'ll not let the kitten\\r\\nhurt you.\"\\nThen she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were one\\r\\nor two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and\\r\\nshe went to the buggy and brought them. Eureka stuck up her nose at such\\r\\nfood, but[Pg 74] the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the\\r\\ncrackers and ate them up in a jiffy.\\n\"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jim\\r\\nhas had enough of the pink grass.\"\\nThe cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.\\n\"I\\'ve tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it\\'s\\r\\nlikely to be a long while between meals in this strange country. But I\\'m\\r\\nready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"\\nSo, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,\\r\\nwhere they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the\\r\\nbuggy and Jim started back to the town.\\n\"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.\\n\"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied\\r\\nthe Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he\\r\\nwould keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess\\r\\nwon\\'t know but that we belong there.\"\\nThey agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim\\r\\ndrew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.\\n\"It doesn\\'t look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing[Pg 75] around at the\\r\\nbare room. \"But it\\'s a place to stay, anyhow.\"\\n\"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some\\r\\nopenings that appeared near the top of the dome.\\n\"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to\\r\\nget to them.\"\\n\"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let us\\r\\nwalk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"\\nWith this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and\\r\\nDorothy and Zeb followed him. It was the same sort of climb one\\r\\nexperiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath\\r\\nwhen they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be\\r\\ndoorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Following\\r\\nthese halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and some\\r\\nwere furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were no\\r\\nbeds at all.\\n\"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.\\n\"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied.\\r\\n\"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we\\r\\ncame, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"\\n\"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have had\\r\\nany sleep, and I\\'m tired. So I think I shall[Pg 76] lie down upon one of these\\r\\nhard glass benches and take a nap.\"\\n\"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the\\r\\nhall.\\nZeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free,\\r\\nrolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eureka\\r\\nnestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned\\r\\nto one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass\\r\\nbench was soon deep in slumberland.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 77]\\n\\nCHAPTER 6.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE MANGABOOS PROVE DANGEROUS\\n\\nHEN the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the\\r\\nLand of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. The\\r\\nlittle man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and\\r\\nlooking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on\\r\\nhis bench and yawning. So the Wizard went in to him.\\n\"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange\\r\\ncountry, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But in\\r\\nthe basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. I wish you\\r\\nwould go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene oil\\r\\nthat is under the seat. There is nothing else that I care about.\"[Pg 78]\\nSo the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had\\r\\nreturned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide what\\r\\nthey should do next, but could think of no way to better their\\r\\ncondition.\\n\"I don\\'t like these veg\\'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They\\'re\\r\\ncold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"\\n\"I agree with you. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"\\r\\nremarked the Wizard.\\n\"And they have no hearts; so they can\\'t love anyone—not even\\r\\nthemselves,\" declared the boy.\\n\"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;\\r\\n\"but I don\\'t care much for her, after all. If there was any other place\\r\\nto go, I\\'d like to go there.\"\\n\"But is there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she answered.\\nJust then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,\\r\\nand going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and\\r\\na throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.\\nSo they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to\\r\\nthem:\\n\"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have\\r\\ndecided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not\\r\\nremain here.\"[Pg 79]\\n\"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the\\r\\nanswer.\\n\"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.\\n\"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"\\r\\nsaid the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies\\r\\nto make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we will\\r\\ndrive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country will\\r\\nbe rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"\\n\"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of\\r\\nthose growing is yet ripe enough to pick. I am greater than any\\r\\nthorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Why destroy me?\"\\n\"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am\\r\\ninformed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to\\r\\ntake the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him\\r\\nto be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to\\r\\nperform. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or\\r\\nnot.\"\\nAt this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of\\r\\nproducing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He did\\r\\nit very cleverly,[Pg 80] indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange\\r\\npiglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could\\r\\nbe. But afterward she said:\\n\"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes nothing of\\r\\nvalue. What else can you do?\"\\nThe Wizard tried to think. Then he jointed together the blades of his\\r\\nsword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. But even\\r\\nthat did not satisfy the Princess.\\nJust then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil\\r\\nwhich Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever\\r\\nidea from those commonplace things.\\n\"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by\\r\\ncreating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit a\\r\\nDestroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\"\\nSo he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and\\r\\nset a lantern upon each of their heads.\\n\"Don\\'t laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of my\\r\\nmagic.\"\\n[Pg 81][Pg 82]\\n\\n\\n\"NOW, PRINCESS,\" EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD.\\n\\nThen, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled\\r\\nface, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. The\\r\\nglare they made was[Pg 83] very small when compared with the radiance of the\\r\\nsix great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. The\\r\\nMangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any\\r\\nlight that did not come directly from their suns.\\nNext the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,\\r\\nwhere it covered quite a broad surface. When he lighted the oil a\\r\\nhundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.\\n\"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who\\r\\nwished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within\\r\\nthis circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right,\\r\\nthey will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, the\\r\\nlight will wither him.\"\\nThe advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded\\r\\nthem to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were\\r\\nscorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of\\r\\nbaked potatoes. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged\\r\\nfrom the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary to\\r\\nplant them at once.\\n\"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any\\r\\nSorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that[Pg 84] my people have\\r\\nadvised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful\\r\\nGarden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the\\r\\nBlack Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them\\r\\naround.\"\\nThe Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself\\r\\nthat he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had gone\\r\\nboth Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit,\\r\\nand Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from\\r\\nsuch a fate.\\nFor two or three days after this—if we call days the periods between\\r\\nsleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days—our friends\\r\\nwere not disturbed in any way. They were even permitted to occupy the\\r\\nHouse of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to\\r\\nwander in the gardens in search of food.\\nOnce they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and\\r\\nwalking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They\\r\\nsaw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and\\r\\ntwisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vines\\r\\ntouched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have\\r\\nescaped being cast among them.\\nWhenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the[Pg 85] nine tiny piglets\\r\\nfrom his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to\\r\\namuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his\\r\\nglass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part\\r\\nof the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could.\\r\\nThey knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she\\r\\nlay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.\\nThe cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and\\r\\nwatched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.\\n\"Don\\'t be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the\\r\\nround, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed\\r\\nthe sport very greatly.\\nSuddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,\\r\\nsolemn-eyed Mangaboos. Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered\\r\\nwith sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the\\r\\nkitten and the piglets.\\n\"Here—stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being\\r\\npricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way\\r\\nof the thorns.\\nThe Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to the\\r\\ndoorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they were\\r\\ndriven from the room and out upon[Pg 86] the street. Here were more of the\\r\\nvegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightened\\r\\ncreatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon the\\r\\ntiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, while\\r\\nEureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also tried\\r\\nto protect the pretty little things from injury. Slowly but steadily the\\r\\nheartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through the\\r\\ncity and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the\\r\\nmountain.\\n\"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape a\\r\\nthorn.\\n\"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they\\r\\nthreatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten. \"If I were as big as you\\r\\nare, Jim, I\\'d fight these miserable turnip-roots!\"\\n\"What would you do?\" enquired Jim.\\n\"I\\'d kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs.\"\\n\"All right,\" said the horse; \"I\\'ll do it.\"\\nAn instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and\\r\\nkicked out his hind legs as hard as he could. A dozen of them smashed\\r\\ntogether and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked\\r\\nagain and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in[Pg 87]\\r\\nall directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron\\r\\nheels. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and\\r\\nscratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetable\\r\\ncomplexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse.\\nBut the foes were too many to be repulsed for long. They tired Jim and\\r\\nEureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered with\\r\\nmashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at last\\r\\nand allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 88]\\n\\nCHAPTER 7.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsINTO THE BLACK PIT AND OUT AGAIN\\nHEN they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunk\\r\\nof deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme.\\r\\nHalf way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the\\r\\npoint where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.\\nThe Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this\\r\\ndark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them—for it seemed\\r\\nsome of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall—they began\\r\\nto pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners could\\r\\nnot get out again.\\n\"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim. \"It will be about the end of our\\r\\nadventures, I guess.\"[Pg 89]\\n\"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"he\\r\\nwould not see us suffer so.\"\\n\"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\"\\r\\nadded Eureka. \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go and\\r\\ntell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue.\"\\nThe mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave a\\r\\nleap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the\\r\\nair. The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up their\\r\\nthorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her. Eureka,\\r\\nhowever, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount only\\r\\nabout a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go\\r\\nnearly two hundred feet. So she ran along over their heads until she had\\r\\nleft them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House of\\r\\nthe Sorcerer. There she entered in at Dorothy\\'s window in the dome and\\r\\naroused her from her sleep.\\nAs soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the\\r\\nWizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue\\r\\nof Jim and the piglets. The Wizard carried his satchel, which was quite\\r\\nheavy, and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can. Dorothy\\'s\\r\\nwicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by good[Pg 90]\\r\\nfortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had\\r\\ntaken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest. So there was\\r\\nnothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close to\\r\\nher bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beating\\r\\nrapidly.\\nSome of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of\\r\\nthe Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable\\r\\npeople allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a\\r\\ncrowd behind them so that they could not go back again.\\nBefore long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos,\\r\\nheaded by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks before\\r\\nthe entrance.\\n\"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at once\\r\\nbegan pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets. Instead of\\r\\nopposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a\\r\\ngood-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they all\\r\\nsprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns.[Pg 91]\\n\\n\\nTHROUGH THE BLACK PIT.\\n\\nDorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb and\\r\\nthe Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad to\\r\\nfollow her. At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass\\r\\nagain, and as the[Pg 92] little man realized that they were all about to be\\r\\nentombed in the mountain he said to the children:\\n\"My dears, what shall we do? Jump out and fight?\"\\n\"What\\'s the use?\" replied Dorothy. \"I\\'d as soon die here as live much\\r\\nlonger among those cruel and heartless people.\"\\n\"That\\'s the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds.\\r\\n\"I\\'ve had enough of the Mangaboos.\"\\n\"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I\\'m with you, whatever you decide. But we\\r\\ncan\\'t live long in this cavern, that\\'s certain.\"\\nNoticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets,\\r\\npatted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed them\\r\\ncarefully in his inside pocket.\\nZeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns. The rays of the\\r\\ncolored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinks\\r\\nhad been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Land\\r\\nof the Mangaboos.\\n\"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"I\\'ll explore it and see,\" replied the boy.\\nSo he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy and\\r\\nthe Wizard followed at his side. The cavern did not come to an end, as\\r\\nthey had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glass\\r\\nmountain, running[Pg 93] in a direction that promised to lead them to the side\\r\\nopposite the Mangaboo country.\\n\"It isn\\'t a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and if we followed it it\\r\\nmight lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black\\r\\npocket we are now in. I suppose the vegetable folk were always afraid to\\r\\nenter this cavern because it is dark; but we have our lanterns to light\\r\\nthe way, so I propose that we start out and discover where this tunnel\\r\\nin the mountain leads to.\"\\nThe others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once the\\r\\nboy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness the\\r\\nthree took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the\\r\\nway, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted\\r\\nlantern so the horse could see where to go.\\nSometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed\\r\\nthe sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor\\r\\nwas usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any\\r\\naccident. Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steep\\r\\nand tiresome.\\n\"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" said\\r\\nDorothy. \"I didn\\'t know this mountain was so tall.\"[Pg 94]\\n\"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\"\\r\\nadded Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started.\"\\nBut they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out with\\r\\nhis long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out the\\r\\nlanterns to save the oil.\\nTo their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, for\\r\\nall were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had\\r\\nmade their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays. The sides of\\r\\nthe tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and\\r\\nthe floor became more level. Jim hastened his lagging steps at this\\r\\nassurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments\\r\\nmore they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to\\r\\nface with a new and charming country.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 95]\\n\\nCHAPTER 8.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE VALLEY OF VOICES\\nY journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful\\r\\nvalley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another\\r\\nrugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty\\r\\ngreen hills at the ends. It was all laid out into lovely lawns and\\r\\ngardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful\\r\\nand stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. There were\\r\\norchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our\\r\\nworld. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their\\r\\nflower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the\\r\\nquaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever[Pg 96] beheld.\\r\\nNone of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had\\r\\nample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.\\nAs the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured\\r\\nby its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, which\\r\\nthey breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel.\\r\\nSeveral minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed\\r\\ntwo very singular and unusual facts about this valley. One was that it\\r\\nwas lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in the\\r\\narched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear and\\r\\nperfect light. The second and even more singular fact was the absence of\\r\\nany inhabitant of this splendid place. From their elevated position they\\r\\ncould overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object could\\r\\nthey see. All appeared mysteriously deserted.\\nThe mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to\\r\\ngranite. With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the\\r\\nloose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths and\\r\\norchards and gardens began. The nearest cottage was still some distance\\r\\naway.\\n\"Isn\\'t it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she[Pg 97] sprang out of\\r\\nthe buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass.\\n\"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb. \"We were lucky to get away from those\\r\\ndreadful vegetable people.\"\\n\"It wouldn\\'t be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if we\\r\\nwere obliged to live here always. We couldn\\'t find a prettier place, I\\'m\\r\\nsure.\"\\nHe took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, and\\r\\nJim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very\\r\\ncontented in his new surroundings.\\n\"We can\\'t walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried it\\r\\nand failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and the\\r\\nWizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they had\\r\\nbeen in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike and\\r\\nnatural.\\n\"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy.\\nThe little man shook his bald head.\\n\"Can\\'t imagine, my dear,\" he replied.\\nThey heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the\\r\\ncreature anywhere. Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest\\r\\ncottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausing\\r\\nat every step for another mouthful of grass.[Pg 98]\\nPresently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves, in\\r\\nthe center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach. The\\r\\nfruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizing\\r\\nand delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:\\n\"What is it, do you s\\'pose?\"\\nThe piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl could\\r\\nreach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had\\r\\nrushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness.\\n\"It\\'s good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn\\'t have\\r\\ngobbled it up so greedily.\"\\n\"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment.\\nThey all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared.\\n\"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away. But I didn\\'t see\\r\\nthem go; did you?\"\\n\"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together.\\n\"Here,—piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously.\\nSeveral squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but the\\r\\nWizard could not discover a single piglet.\\n\"Where are you?\" he asked.\\n\"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice. \"Can\\'t you see us?\"[Pg 99]\\n\\n\\n\"ARE THERE REALLY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM?\"\\n\\n[Pg 100]\\n\"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone.\\n\"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets.[Pg 101]\\nThe Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the small\\r\\nfat body of one of his pets. He picked it up, but could not see what he\\r\\nheld.\\n\"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly. \"The piglets have become\\r\\ninvisible, in some curious way.\"\\n\"I\\'ll bet it\\'s because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten.\\n\"It wasn\\'t a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy. \"I only hope it wasn\\'t\\r\\npoison.\"\\n\"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets.\\n\"We\\'ll eat all we can find of them,\" said another.\\n\"But we mus\\'n\\'t eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we too\\r\\nmay become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another of\\r\\nthe strange fruit we must avoid it.\"\\nCalling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and put\\r\\nthem away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he could\\r\\nfeel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for\\r\\nthe present.\\nThe travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which they\\r\\npresently reached. It was a pretty place, with vines growing thickly\\r\\nover the broad front porch. The door stood open and a table was set in\\r\\nthe front room, with[Pg 102] four chairs drawn up to it. On the table were\\r\\nplates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits. The meat\\r\\nwas smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics\\r\\nand jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way. But not a single\\r\\nperson appeared to be in the room.\\n\"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood in\\r\\nthe doorway.\\nA peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell to\\r\\nthe plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed back from the table,\\r\\nand this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost\\r\\ntempted to run away in fright.\\n\"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of some\\r\\nunseen person.\\n\"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly.\\n\"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent.\\n\"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room?\"\\n\"Of course,\" replied the man\\'s voice.\\n\"And—pardon me for the foolish question—but, are you all invisible?\"\\n\"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rip[Pg 103]pling laughter.\\r\\n\"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe?\"\\n\"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard. \"All the people I have ever met before\\r\\nwere very plain to see.\"\\n\"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone.\\n\"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"but\\r\\nrecently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in the\\r\\nCountry of the Mangaboos.\"\\n\"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman\\'s voice. \"I\\'ve heard of them.\"\\n\"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we found\\r\\nthere was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here. It is a\\r\\nbeautiful place. What do you call it?\"\\n\"It is the Valley of Voe.\"\\n\"Thank you. We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to this\\r\\nhouse to enquire our way.\"\\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman\\'s voice.\\n\"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"So could I,\" added Zeb.\\n\"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened to\\r\\nsay.[Pg 104]\\n\"That\\'s all right,\" returned the man\\'s voice, more pleasantly than\\r\\nbefore. \"You are welcome to what we have.\"\\nAs he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm.\\r\\nTwo childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was sure\\r\\nthey were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those\\r\\nfolks couldn\\'t be seen.\\n\"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?\"\\r\\nenquired the man\\'s voice.\\n\"That\\'s Jim,\" said the girl. \"He\\'s a horse.\"\\n\"What is he good for?\" was the next question.\\n\"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggy\\r\\ninstead of walking,\" she explained.\\n\"Can he fight?\" asked the man\\'s voice.\\n\"No! he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jim\\r\\ncan\\'t \\'zactly fight,\" she replied.\\n\"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children\\'s voices.\\n\"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Are these bears here?\"\\n\"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man. \"Many\\r\\nlarge and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they can\\r\\ncatch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom get\\r\\ncaught.\"\\n\"Are the bears invis\\'ble, too?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and[Pg 105] that keeps them\\r\\nfrom being seen by any eye, whether human or animal.\"\\n\"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like a\\r\\npeach?\" asked the Wizard.\\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\\n\"If it makes you invis\\'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired.\\n\"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman\\'s voice answered. \"The dama-fruit\\r\\nis the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisible\\r\\nthe bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, your\\r\\nluncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as you\\r\\nlike.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 106]\\n\\nCHAPTER 9.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHEY FIGHT THE INVISIBLE BEARS\\nHE strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for they\\r\\nwere all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things to\\r\\neat. In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the delicious\\r\\ndama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing and\\r\\nsweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible.\\nBut Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companions\\r\\ndid likewise, resisting the temptation.\\n\"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman\\'s voice.\\n\"We don\\'t want to get invis\\'ble,\" answered the girl.\\n\"But if you remain visible the bears will see you and[Pg 107] devour you,\" said\\r\\na girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children. \"We who\\r\\nlive here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss one\\r\\nanother, and are quite safe from the bears.\"\\n\"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked the\\r\\nman.\\n\"And mama can\\'t tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the other\\r\\nchildish voice, gleefully.\\n\"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;\\r\\n\"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see it\\r\\nor not.\"\\nDorothy laughed and stretched out her hands.\\n\"Come here, please—Ianu and your sister—and let me feel of you,\" she\\r\\nrequested.\\nThey came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over their\\r\\nfaces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and the\\r\\nother a boy somewhat smaller. The girl\\'s hair was soft and fluffy and\\r\\nher skin as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose and\\r\\nears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed.\\n\"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared.\\nThe girl laughed, and her mother said:\\n\"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can[Pg 108] not display our\\r\\nbeauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to\\r\\nour companions. Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,\\r\\nthe dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of the\\r\\nsky.\"\\n\"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb.\\n\"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as much\\r\\nas we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them. Neither can we\\r\\nsee the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit. But the fishes that\\r\\nswim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat.\"\\n\"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even while\\r\\ninvisible,\" remarked the Wizard. \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remain\\r\\nvisible while we are in your valley.\"\\nJust then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outside\\r\\nwith Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:\\n\"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I\\'m half starved.\"\\nThe children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the small\\r\\nanimal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them by\\r\\nexplaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she wished\\r\\nto. Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the table, the\\r\\nkitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see what\\r\\nthere was to eat. To her surprise an unseen hand[Pg 109] clutched her and held\\r\\nher suspended in the air. Eureka was frantic with terror, and tried to\\r\\nscratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to the floor.\\n\"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" she gasped.\\n\"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in this\\r\\nhouse, although we cannot see them. And you must have better manners,\\r\\nEureka, or something worse will happen to you.\"\\nShe placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily.\\n\"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, when\\r\\nshe had cleaned the plate.\\n\"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,\\r\\nEureka, or you\\'ll get invis\\'ble, and then we can\\'t see you at all.\"\\nThe kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit.\\n\"Does it hurt to be invis\\'ble?\" she asked.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre\\'fully to\\r\\nlose you.\"\\n\"Very well, I won\\'t touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep it\\r\\naway from me, for the smell is very tempting.\"\\n\"Can you tell us, sir or ma\\'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the air\\r\\nbecause he did not quite know where the unseen[Pg 110] people stood, \"if there\\r\\nis any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of the\\r\\nEarth again.\"\\n\"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man\\'s voice;\\r\\n\"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country. As for\\r\\nreaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible to\\r\\ndo that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably fall\\r\\noff.\"\\n\"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we\\'ve been there, and we know.\"\\n\"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;\\r\\n\"but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own, for long.\\r\\nEven if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,\\r\\nin order to reach the earth\\'s surface, to keep moving on toward it.\"\\n\"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross our\\r\\nValley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain. The\\r\\ntop of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it you\\r\\nwill be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live.\"\\n\"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb.\\n\"I do not know, young sir. Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, once\\r\\nclimbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoyles\\r\\nbefore he could escape them and come back; but he could never be induced\\r\\nto describe[Pg 111] the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear caught\\r\\nhim and ate him up.\"\\nThe wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothy\\r\\nsaid with a sigh:\\n\"If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles, then we\\'ve got to\\r\\nmeet \\'em. They can\\'t be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King.\"\\n\"But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to help\\r\\nyou conquer those enemies,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Just now, my dear,\\r\\nthere is not a single warrior in your company.\"\\n\"Oh, I guess Zeb could fight if he had to. Couldn\\'t you, Zeb?\" asked the\\r\\nlittle girl.\\n\"Perhaps; if I had to,\" answered Zeb, doubtfully.\\n\"And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the veg\\'table Sorcerer\\r\\nin two with,\" the girl said to the little man.\\n\"True,\" he replied; \"and in my satchel are other useful things to fight\\r\\nwith.\"\\n\"What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise,\" said the man\\'s voice. \"Our\\r\\nChampion told me that when he shouted his battle-cry the creatures\\r\\nshuddered and drew back, hesitating to continue the combat. But they\\r\\nwere in great numbers, and the Champion could not shout much because he\\r\\nhad to save his breath for fighting.\"[Pg 112]\\n\"Very good,\" said the Wizard; \"we can all yell better than we can fight,\\r\\nso we ought to defeat the Gargoyles.\"\\n\"But tell me,\" said Dorothy, \"how did such a brave Champion happen to\\r\\nlet the bears eat him? And if he was invis\\'ble, and the bears invis\\'ble,\\r\\nwho knows that they really ate him up?\"\\n\"The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time,\" returned the unseen\\r\\nman; \"and we know this is true because when any creature is dead the\\r\\ninvisible charm of the dama-fruit ceases to be active, and the slain one\\r\\ncan be plainly seen by all eyes. When the Champion killed a bear\\r\\neveryone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all saw\\r\\nseveral pieces of him scattered about, which of course disappeared again\\r\\nwhen the bears devoured them.\"\\nThey now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage, and\\r\\nafter the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped\\r\\nmountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travel\\r\\nin order to reach it, they again started upon their journey.\\nThey followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more\\r\\npretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak to\\r\\nthem. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were many\\r\\nof the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of.[Pg 113]\\nAbout noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty\\r\\norchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums\\r\\nthat grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:\\n\"There are bears near by. Be careful.\"\\nThe Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip.\\r\\nDorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed from\\r\\nit and was grazing some distance away.\\nThe owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said:\\n\"You cannot escape the bears that way.\"\\n\"How can we \\'scape?\" asked Dorothy, nervously, for an unseen danger is\\r\\nalways the hardest to face.\\n\"You must take to the river,\" was the reply. \"The bears will not venture\\r\\nupon the water.\"\\n\"But we would be drowned!\" exclaimed the girl.\\n\"Oh, there is no need of that,\" said the voice, which from its gentle\\r\\ntones seemed to belong to a young girl. \"You are strangers in the Valley\\r\\nof Voe, and do not seem to know our ways; so I will try to save you.\"\\nThe next moment a broad-leaved plant was jerked from the ground where it\\r\\ngrew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard.[Pg 114]\\n\\n\\nESCAPING THE INVISIBLE BEARS.\\n\\n\"Sir,\" said the voice, \"you must rub these leaves upon the[Pg 115] soles of\\r\\nall your feet, and then you will be able to walk upon the water without\\r\\nsinking below the surface. It is a secret the bears do not know, and we\\r\\npeople of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so escape\\r\\nour enemies.\"\\n\"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf upon\\r\\nthe soles of Dorothy\\'s shoes and then upon his own. The girl took a leaf\\r\\nand rubbed it upon the kitten\\'s paws, and the rest of the plant was\\r\\nhanded to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully rubbed\\r\\nit upon all four of Jim\\'s hoofs and then upon the tires of the\\r\\nbuggy-wheels. He had nearly finished this last task when a low growling\\r\\nwas suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously\\r\\nwith his heels.\\n\"Quick! To the water, or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, and\\r\\nwithout hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon\\r\\nthe broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her\\r\\narms. They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strange\\r\\nplant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream\\r\\nthe Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim.\\nThe horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashes\\r\\nappeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely.\\n\"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim[Pg 116] quickly freed himself\\r\\nfrom his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed. As\\r\\nsoon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself\\r\\nsafe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water toward\\r\\nDorothy.\\nAs the little Wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against\\r\\nhis cheek and heard a low, fierce growl. At once he began stabbing at\\r\\nthe air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substance\\r\\nbecause when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood. The\\r\\nthird time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a\\r\\nfall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,\\r\\nwhich was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. The\\r\\nbeast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at its\\r\\nterrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and\\r\\nrushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bears\\r\\nwere near.\\nOn the river, however, the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe.\\r\\nDorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current of\\r\\nthe water, and the others made haste to join her. The Wizard opened his\\r\\nsatchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the cuts\\r\\nJim had received from the claws of the bears.[Pg 117]\\n\"I think we\\'d better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy. \"If\\r\\nour unknown friend hadn\\'t warned us, and told us what to do, we would\\r\\nall be dead by this time.\"\\n\"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be flowing\\r\\nin the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way for\\r\\nus to travel.\"\\nZeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drew\\r\\nthem rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfully\\r\\nafraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka was\\r\\nfrisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once a\\r\\nlittle fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in her\\r\\nmouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to be\\r\\ncareful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fishes\\r\\nwere careless enough to swim within reach.\\nAfter a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river\\r\\ncurved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley before\\r\\nthey came to the Pyramid Mountain. There were few houses in this part,\\r\\nand few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they might encounter\\r\\nmore of the savage bears, which they had learned to dread with all their\\r\\nhearts.\\n\"You\\'ll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast as\\r\\nyou can go.\"[Pg 118]\\n\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I\\'ll do my best. But you must remember\\r\\nI\\'m old, and my dashing days are past and gone.\"\\nAll three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim\\r\\nneeded no guidance of any sort. The horse was still smarting from the\\r\\nsharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land and\\r\\nheaded toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome\\r\\ncreatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in\\r\\na way that made Dorothy catch her breath.\\nThen Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of the\\r\\nbears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew. His boney legs moved\\r\\nso fast they could scarcely be seen, and the Wizard clung fast to the\\r\\nseat and yelled \"Whoa!\" at the top of his voice.\\n\"I—I\\'m \\'fraid he\\'s—he\\'s running away!\" gasped Dorothy.\\n\"I know he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps up\\r\\nthat gait—and the harness or the buggy don\\'t break.\"\\nJim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware of\\r\\nit he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizard\\r\\nand Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the soft\\r\\ngrass—where they rolled over[Pg 119] several times before they stopped.\\r\\nDorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron rail\\r\\nof the seat, and that saved her. She squeezed the kitten, though, until\\r\\nit screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious sounds\\r\\nthat led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 120]\\n\\nCHAPTER 10.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE BRAIDED MAN OF PYRAMID MOUNTAIN\\n\\nHE mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its\\r\\npoint was lost in the clouds. Directly facing the place where Jim had\\r\\nstopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway. The stairs\\r\\nwere cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and not\\r\\nvery steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at the\\r\\narched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big. At the\\r\\nfoot of the stairs was a sign reading:\\nWARNING.\\nThese steps lead to the\\nLand of the Gargoyles.\\nDANGER! KEEP OUT.\\n\"I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs,\"\\r\\nsaid Dorothy, gravely.\\n[Pg 121]\\n\"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh.\\r\\n\"Still, I don\\'t care to drag any passengers. You\\'ll all have to walk.\"\\n\"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully.\\n\"Then you\\'ll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that\\'s all,\" answered Jim.\\n\"We\\'ll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard. \"It\\'s the only way to get out\\r\\nof the Valley of Voe.\"\\nSo they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jim\\r\\nnext, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened to\\r\\nthe harness.\\nThe light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so that\\r\\nthe Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way. But\\r\\nthis enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where\\r\\nthere was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and\\r\\nair. Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lying\\r\\nfar below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance.\\nAfter resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still the\\r\\nstairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw[Pg 122] the buggy easily after\\r\\nhim. The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get his\\r\\nbreath. At such times they were all glad to wait for him, for\\r\\ncontinually climbing up stairs is sure to make one\\'s legs ache.\\nThey wound about, always going upward, for some time. The lights from\\r\\nthe lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and they\\r\\nwere pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were\\r\\ncoming to a second landing.\\nHere one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth of\\r\\na cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and\\r\\ncommenced ascending again at the opposite edge.\\nThe opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley of\\r\\nVoe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene. Below them was\\r\\na vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling\\r\\nbillows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up. Just\\r\\nabove them, and almost on a level with their platform, were banks of\\r\\nrolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color. The\\r\\nblues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on the\\r\\ncloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful beings\\r\\nwho must have been the Cloud Fairies. Mortals who stand upon the earth\\r\\nand look[Pg 123] up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms, but our\\r\\nfriends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty\\r\\nfairies very clearly.\\n\"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice.\\n\"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly. \"They are the Cloud Fairies.\"\\n\"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently. \"If I\\r\\nshould squeeze one, there wouldn\\'t be anything left of it.\"\\nIn the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea far\\r\\nbeneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way\\r\\nswiftly through the air. These birds were of enormous size, and reminded\\r\\nZeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights. They had fierce\\r\\neyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none of them\\r\\nwould venture into the cavern.\\n\"Well, I declare!\" suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard. \"What in the\\r\\nworld is this?\"\\nThey turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center\\r\\nof the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their\\r\\nattention. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerest\\r\\nthing about him was his white hair and beard. These were so long that\\r\\nthey reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were\\r\\ncare[Pg 124]fully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastened\\r\\nwith a bow of colored ribbon.\\n\"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly.\\n\"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, not\\r\\nrecently. Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have had\\r\\nmy factory in this spot—half way up Pyramid Mountain.\"\\n\"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone.\\n\"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man. \"But as I have never\\r\\nbeen in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot be\\r\\npositive whether it is exactly half way or not.\"\\n\"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had been\\r\\nexamining the strange personage carefully.\\n\"To be sure,\" said the other. \"I am a great inventor, you must know, and\\r\\nI manufacture my products in this lonely spot.\"\\n\"What are your products?\" enquired the Wizard.\\n\"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superior\\r\\ngrade of Rustles for ladies\\' silk gowns.\"\\n\"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh. \"May we examine some of\\r\\nthese articles?\"[Pg 125]\\n\\n\\nTHE CLOUD FAIRIES.\\n\\n[Pg 126]\\n\\n\\nTHE BRAIDED MAN.\\n\\n[Pg 127][Pg 128]\\n\"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned and\\r\\nled the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived. Here, on a\\r\\nbroad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each tied\\r\\nwith cotton cord.\\n\"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"contains\\r\\ntwelve dozen rustles—enough to last any lady a year. Will you buy it,\\r\\nmy dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy.\\n\"My gown isn\\'t silk,\" she said, smiling.\\n\"Never mind. When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether you\\r\\nare wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously. Then he\\r\\npicked up another box. \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assorted\\r\\nflutters. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, when\\r\\nthere is no wind. You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to have this\\r\\nassortment. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never be\\r\\nwithout them.\"\\n\"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively.\\n\"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spend\\r\\nit in this deserted place if I had it. But I would like very much a blue\\r\\nhair-ribbon. You will notice my braids are tied with yellow, pink,\\r\\nbrown, red, green, white and black; but I have no blue ribbons.\"[Pg 129]\\n\"I\\'ll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; so\\r\\nshe ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blue\\r\\nribbon. It did her good to see how the braided man\\'s eyes sparkled when\\r\\nhe received this treasure.\\n\"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then he\\r\\ninsisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl\\r\\naccepting the box of rustles.\\n\"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use in\\r\\nmy manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them.\"\\n\"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard.\\n\"I could not help it. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrain\\r\\nyour tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer of\\r\\nImported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that I\\r\\nsupplied a superior article, which was in great demand. Also I made\\r\\npores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for doughnuts and\\r\\nbuttons. Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole, which I thought\\r\\nwould make my fortune. I manufactured a large quantity of these\\r\\npost-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set them all end\\r\\nto end and put the top one in the ground. That made an extraordinary\\r\\nlong hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into the earth; and,\\r\\nas[Pg 130] I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost my balance and\\r\\ntumbled in. Unfortunately, the hole led directly into the vast space you\\r\\nsee outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a point of rock that\\r\\nprojected from this cavern, and so saved myself from tumbling headlong\\r\\ninto the black waves beneath, where the tongues of flame that dart out\\r\\nwould certainly have consumed me. Here, then, I made my home; and\\r\\nalthough it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles and\\r\\nflutters, and so get along very nicely.\"\\nWhen the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearly\\r\\nlaughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped his\\r\\nforehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man was\\r\\ncrazy. So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outer\\r\\ncavern to resume their journey.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 131]\\n\\nCHAPTER 11.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHEY MEET THE WOODEN GARGOYLES\\n\\nNOTHER breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing\\r\\nwhere there was a rift in the mountain. On peering out all they could\\r\\nsee was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.\\nBut the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting on\\r\\nthe rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine\\r\\ntiny piglets. To his delight they were now plainly visible, which proved\\r\\nthat they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe.\\n\"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully.\\n\"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and[Pg 132] the sight\\r\\nmakes me dreadfully hungry. Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one of\\r\\nthe fat little piglets? You\\'d never miss one of them, I\\'m sure!\"\\n\"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and after we\\'ve been\\r\\nsuch good friends, too, and played with one another!\"\\n\"When I\\'m not hungry, I love to play with you all,\" said the kitten,\\r\\ndemurely; \"but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fill\\r\\nit so nicely as a fat piglet.\"\\n\"And we trusted you so!\" said another of the nine, reproachfully.\\n\"And thought you were respectable!\" said another.\\n\"It seems we were mistaken,\" declared a third, looking at the kitten\\r\\ntimorously, \"no one with such murderous desires should belong to our\\r\\nparty, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\"You see, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy, reprovingly, \"you are making\\r\\nyourself disliked. There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat;\\r\\nbut I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under any cir\\'stances.\"\\n\"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten. \"They are\\r\\nno bigger than mice, and I\\'m sure mice are proper for me to eat.\"\\n\"It isn\\'t the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl. \"These\\r\\nare Mr. Wizard\\'s pets, just as you are my pet,[Pg 133] and it wouldn\\'t be any\\r\\nmore proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you.\"\\n\"And that\\'s just what I shall do if you don\\'t let those little balls of\\r\\npork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes.\\r\\n\"If you injure any one of them I\\'ll chew you up instantly.\"\\nThe kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decide\\r\\nwhether he meant it or not.\\n\"In that case,\" she said, \"I\\'ll leave them alone. You haven\\'t many teeth\\r\\nleft, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. So\\r\\nthe piglets will be perfectly safe, hereafter, as far as I am\\r\\nconcerned.\"\\n\"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the Wizard, earnestly. \"Let us all be\\r\\na happy family and love one another.\"\\nEureka yawned and stretched herself.\\n\"I\\'ve always loved the piglets,\" she said; \"but they don\\'t love me.\"\\n\"No one can love a person he\\'s afraid of,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If you\\r\\nbehave, and don\\'t scare the little pigs, I\\'m sure they\\'ll grow very fond\\r\\nof you.\"\\nThe Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and the\\r\\njourney was resumed.\\n\"We must be pretty near the top, now,\" said the boy, as they climbed\\r\\nwearily up the dark, winding stairway.[Pg 134]\\n\"The Country of the Gurgles can\\'t be far from the top of the earth,\"\\r\\nremarked Dorothy. \"It isn\\'t very nice down here. I\\'d like to get home\\r\\nagain, I\\'m sure.\"\\nNo one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breath\\r\\nfor the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard\\r\\noften had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keep\\r\\nit from jamming against the rocky walls.\\nAt last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew clearer\\r\\nand stronger as they advanced.\\n\"Thank goodness we\\'re nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard.\\nJim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck his\\r\\nhead above the rocky sides of the stairway. Then he halted, ducked down\\r\\nand began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the\\r\\nothers.\\n\"Let\\'s go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice.\\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard. \"What\\'s the matter with you, old\\r\\nman?\"\\n\"Everything,\" grumbled the horse. \"I\\'ve taken a look at this place, and\\r\\nit\\'s no fit country for real creatures to go to. Everything\\'s dead, up\\r\\nthere—no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere.\"[Pg 135]\\n\"Never mind; we can\\'t turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don\\'t intend to\\r\\nstay there, anyhow.\"\\n\"It\\'s dangerous,\" growled Jim, in a stubborn tone.\\n\"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and I\\r\\nhave been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escaped\\r\\nwithout harm. We\\'ve even been to the marvelous Land of Oz—haven\\'t we,\\r\\nDorothy?—so we don\\'t much care what the Country of the Gargoyles is\\r\\nlike. Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we\\'ll make the best of it.\"\\n\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;\\r\\nso if you get into trouble don\\'t blame me.\"\\nWith this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining\\r\\nsteps. The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad\\r\\nplatform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes\\r\\nhad ever beheld.\\n\"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so it\\r\\nwas. The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard\\r\\nknots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. There were odd wooden\\r\\nhouses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards. The tree-trunks\\r\\nwere of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings. The\\r\\npatches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass nor\\r\\nsawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring.[Pg 136] Wooden birds fluttered\\r\\namong the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; but\\r\\nthe most amazing things of all were the wooden people—the creatures\\r\\nknown as Gargoyles.\\nThese were very numerous, for the palace was thickly inhabited, and a\\r\\nlarge group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon the\\r\\nstrangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway.\\nThe Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet in\\r\\nheight. Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and their\\r\\narms extraordinarily long and stout. Their heads were too big for their\\r\\nbodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon. Some had long,\\r\\ncurved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths. Others had\\r\\nflat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of an\\r\\nelephant. There were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; but\\r\\nall were equally disagreeable in appearance. The tops of their heads had\\r\\nno hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some having\\r\\na row of points or balls around the top, other designs resembling\\r\\nflowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked like\\r\\nwaffles cut criss-cross on their heads. They all wore short wooden wings\\r\\nwhich were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges\\r\\nwith wooden screws, and[Pg 137] with these wings they flew swiftly and\\r\\nnoiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them.\\nThis noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the\\r\\nGargoyles. They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying to\\r\\nspeak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with\\r\\ntheir wooden fingers or lips. Neither was there any sound to be heard\\r\\nanywhere throughout the wooden country. The birds did not sing, nor did\\r\\nthe cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere.\\nThe group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near\\r\\nthe stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evil\\r\\neyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land. In\\r\\nturn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined the\\r\\nGargoyles with the same silent attention.\\n\"There\\'s going to be trouble, I\\'m sure,\" remarked the horse. \"Unhitch\\r\\nthose tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fight\\r\\ncomfortably.\"\\n\"Jim\\'s right,\" sighed the Wizard. \"There\\'s going to be trouble, and my\\r\\nsword isn\\'t stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies—so I shall have\\r\\nto get out my revolvers.\"\\nHe got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadly\\r\\nlooking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to\\r\\nlook at.[Pg 138]\\n\"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy. \"They have no weapons to\\r\\nhurt us with.\"\\n\"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and I\\'m\\r\\nsure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes. Even these\\r\\nrevolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies,\\r\\nand after that we will be at their mercy.\"\\n\"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl.\\n\"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely.\\r\\n\"It\\'s every man\\'s duty to do the best he knows how; and I\\'m going to do\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse.\\n\"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along several\\r\\nother useful things,\" responded the Wizard. \"But we dropped into this\\r\\nadventure rather unexpectedly.\"\\nThe Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of\\r\\ntalking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words\\r\\nseemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as the\\r\\nconversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and\\r\\nflew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before\\r\\nthem like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats. The horse had\\r\\nespecially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest[Pg 139] and\\r\\nstrangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their\\r\\nfirst attack.\\nBut Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned his\\r\\nheels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could. Crack!\\r\\ncrash! bang! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the\\r\\nGargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force that\\r\\nthey scattered like straws in the wind. But the noise and clatter seemed\\r\\nas dreadful to them as Jim\\'s heels, for all who were able swiftly turned\\r\\nand flew away to a great distance. The others picked themselves up from\\r\\nthe ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for a\\r\\nmoment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease.\\nBut the Wizard was not so confident.\\n\"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all the\\r\\ndamage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their noses\\r\\nand ears. That cannot make them look any uglier, I\\'m sure, and it is my\\r\\nopinion they will soon renew the attack.\"\\n\"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"The noise, of course. Don\\'t you remember how the Champion escaped them\\r\\nby shouting his battle-cry?\"\\n\"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the[Pg 140] boy. \"We have\\r\\ntime, just now, and I\\'d rather face the invis\\'ble bears than those\\r\\nwooden imps.\"\\n\"No,\" returned Dorothy, stoutly, \"it won\\'t do to go back, for then we\\r\\nwould never get home. Let\\'s fight it out.\"\\n\"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard. \"They haven\\'t defeated us yet,\\r\\nand Jim is worth a whole army.\"\\nBut the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next\\r\\ntime. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more of\\r\\ntheir kind, and they flew straight over Jim\\'s head to where the others\\r\\nwere standing.\\nThe Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his\\r\\nenemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent\\r\\nplace.\\nSome of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quivered\\r\\nand trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escape\\r\\nagain to a distance.\\nZeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him. The\\r\\ntop of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard\\'s bullet had\\r\\nstruck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot. Half of\\r\\nthe bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the jar\\r\\nand the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than the\\r\\nfact that it was really hurt. Before this crowned Gargoyle had recovered\\r\\nhimself Zeb had wound a strap several[Pg 141] times around its body, confining\\r\\nits wings and arms so that it could not move. Then, having tied the\\r\\nwooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed his\\r\\nprisoner into the buggy. By that time the others had all retired.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 142]\\n\\nCHAPTER 12.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsA WONDERFUL ESCAPE\\n\\nOR a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack. Then a few of them\\r\\nadvanced until another shot from the Wizard\\'s revolver made them\\r\\nretreat.\\n\"That\\'s fine,\" said Zeb. \"We\\'ve got \\'em on the run now, sure enough.\"\\n\"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily.\\r\\n\"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone we\\r\\nshall be helpless.\"[Pg 143]\\nThe Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their band\\r\\ntime after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the\\r\\nlittle man\\'s revolvers. In this way none of them was shocked by the\\r\\ndreadful report more than once, for the main band kept[Pg 144] far away and\\r\\neach time a new company was sent into the battle. When the Wizard had\\r\\nfired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy\\r\\nexcept to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victory\\r\\nthan in the beginning of the fray.\\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.\\n\"Let\\'s yell—all together,\" said Zeb.[Pg 145]\\n\\n\\nTHE WIZARD FIRED INTO THE THRONG.\\n\\n\"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard. \"We will get near Jim,\\r\\nso that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do the\\r\\nbest he can. I\\'ll use my sword, although it isn\\'t much account in this\\r\\naffair. Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the\\r\\nwooden folks attack her. I haven\\'t anything for you, Zeb.\"\\n\"I\\'ll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of the\\r\\nbuggy. The bound Gargoyle\\'s arms extended far out beyond its head, so by\\r\\ngrasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club. The boy\\r\\nwas strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so he\\r\\nwas likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard.\\nWhen the next company of Gargoyles advanced, our adventurers began\\r\\nyelling as if they had gone mad. Even the kitten gave a dreadfully\\r\\nshrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly.\\r\\nThis daunted the[Pg 146] enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out of\\r\\nbreath. Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more of\\r\\nthe awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced in\\r\\na swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them.\\nDorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearly\\r\\ncovered her and proved a great protection. The Wizard\\'s sword-blade\\r\\nsnapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the\\r\\nwooden people. Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club\\r\\nuntil he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clustered\\r\\nso thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his\\r\\narms. The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eureka\\r\\nassisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bit\\r\\nat them like a wild-cat.\\nBut all this bravery amounted to nothing at all. The wooden things wound\\r\\ntheir long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast. Dorothy\\r\\nwas captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles clung to\\r\\nJim\\'s legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless.\\r\\nEureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground\\r\\nlike a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her\\r\\nbefore she had gone very far.\\nAll of them expected nothing less than instant death; but[Pg 147] to their\\r\\nsurprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them\\r\\nfar away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to a\\r\\nwooden city. The houses of this city had many corners, being square and\\r\\nsix-sided and eight-sided. They were tower-like in shape and the best of\\r\\nthem seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial.\\nTo one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only one\\r\\nbroad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were brought by\\r\\ntheir captors. The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening, where\\r\\nthere was a platform, and then flew away and left them. As they had no\\r\\nwings the strangers could not fly away, and if they jumped down from\\r\\nsuch a height they would surely be killed. The creatures had sense\\r\\nenough to reason that way, and the only mistake they made was in\\r\\nsupposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinary\\r\\ndifficulties.\\nJim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoyles\\r\\nto carry the big beast through the air and land him on the high\\r\\nplatform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged to\\r\\nthe party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for or\\r\\nwhether it was alive or not. When Eureka\\'s captor had thrown the kitten\\r\\nafter[Pg 148] the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving our\\r\\nfriends to breathe freely once more.\\n\"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in little\\r\\ngasps.\\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with her\\r\\npaw; \"we didn\\'t manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us.\"\\n\"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" sighed\\r\\nthe little girl.\\n\"I wonder why they didn\\'t kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who had\\r\\nlost his king in the struggle.\\n\"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,\\r\\nreflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as\\r\\npossible in a short time.\"\\n\"As dead as poss\\'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn\\'t it?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Yes, my dear. But we have no need to worry about that just now. Let us\\r\\nexamine our prison and see what it is like.\"\\nThe space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to see\\r\\non all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosity\\r\\nat the city spread out beneath them. Everything visible was made of\\r\\nwood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural.\\nFrom their platform a stair descended into the house, and[Pg 149] the children\\r\\nand the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the\\r\\nway. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothing\\r\\nmore; so after a time they came back to the platform again. Had there\\r\\nbeen any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of\\r\\nthe house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but to\\r\\nremain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, and\\r\\nthey did not like the darkness or the damp smell.\\nIn this country, as in all others they had visited underneath the\\r\\nearth\\'s surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light coming\\r\\nfrom some unknown source. Looking out, they could see into some of the\\r\\nhouses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and were\\r\\nable to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their\\r\\ndwellings.\\n\"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard. \"All people\\r\\nneed rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no night here\\r\\nthey select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze.\"\\n\"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning.\\n\"Why, where\\'s Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly.\\nThey all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen.[Pg 150]\\n\"She\\'s gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly.\\n\"Where? On the roof?\" asked the girl.\\n\"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of\\r\\nthis house to the ground.\"\\n\"She couldn\\'t climb down, Jim,\" said Dorothy. \"To climb means to go\\r\\nup.\"\\n\"Who said so?\" demanded the horse.\\n\"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim.\"\\n\"To \\'climb down\\' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked the\\r\\nWizard.\\n\"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she went down,\\r\\nanyhow, whether she climbed or crept.\"\\n\"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed.\\r\\n\"The Gurgles will get her, sure!\"\\n\"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they\\'re not \\'Gurgles,\\' little\\r\\nmaid; they\\'re Gargoyles.\"\\n\"Never mind; they\\'ll get Eureka, whatever they\\'re called.\"\\n\"No they won\\'t,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herself\\r\\ncrawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the\\r\\nfloor.\\n\"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" asked Dorothy, sternly.\\n\"Watching the wooden folks. They\\'re too funny for any[Pg 151]thing, Dorothy.\\r\\nJust now they are all going to bed, and—what do you think?—they unhook\\r\\nthe hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake up\\r\\nagain.\"\\n\"What, the hinges?\"\\n\"No; the wings.\"\\n\"That,\" said Zeb, \"explains why this house is used by them for a prison.\\r\\nIf any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail, they are\\r\\nbrought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them until\\r\\nthey promise to be good.\"\\nThe Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said.\\n\"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said.\\n\"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"I think so. If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly\\r\\nlies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the people\\r\\nwho wear them. So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly as well as\\r\\nthey do—at least while we are in their country and under the spell of\\r\\nits magic.\"\\n\"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl.\\n\"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners of\\r\\nthe building. \"Do you see that big rock stand[Pg 152]ing on the hillside\\r\\nyonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger.\\n\"Yes; it\\'s a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied.\\n\"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an archway\\r\\nvery much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairway\\r\\nfrom the Valley of Voe. I\\'ll get my spy-glass, and then you can see it[Pg 153]\\r\\nmore plainly.\"\\nHe fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in his\\r\\nsatchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening.\\n\"Where does it lead to?\" she asked.\\n\"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far below[Pg 154]\\r\\nthe earth\\'s surface, and that entrance may lead to another stairway that\\r\\nwill bring us on top of our world again, where we belong. So, if we had\\r\\nthe wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that rock and\\r\\nbe saved.\"\\n\"I\\'ll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to all\\r\\nthis. \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are.\"\\n\"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly.\\nFor answer Zeb began to unfasten Jim\\'s harness, strap by[Pg 155] strap, and\\r\\nto buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip\\r\\nthat would reach to the ground.\\n\\n\\nTHE FIGHT WITH THE GARGOYLES.\\n\\n\"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said.\\n\"No you can\\'t,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes. \"You may\\r\\ngo down, but you can only climb up.\"\\n\"Well, I\\'ll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a laugh.\\r\\n\"Now, Eureka, you\\'ll have to show me the way to those wings.\"\\n\"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the least\\r\\nnoise the Gargoyles will wake up. They can hear a pin drop.\"\\n\"I\\'m not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb.\\nHe had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now he\\r\\nlet the line dangle over the side of the house.\\n\"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly.\\n\"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge.\\nThe girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way\\r\\ncarefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the ground\\r\\nbelow. Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house and\\r\\nlet herself down easily. Then together they crept away to enter the low\\r\\ndoorway of a neighboring dwelling.[Pg 156]\\nThe watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared,\\r\\nhis arms now full of the wooden wings.\\nWhen he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in a\\r\\nbunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up. Then the line\\r\\nwas let down again for Zeb to climb up by. Eureka quickly followed him,\\r\\nand soon they were all standing together upon the platform, with eight\\r\\nof the much prized wooden wings beside them.\\nThe boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement. He put\\r\\nthe harness together again and hitched Jim to the buggy. Then, with the\\r\\nWizard\\'s help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the old\\r\\ncab-horse.\\nThis was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of the\\r\\nwings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoyle\\r\\nwho had used it. However, the Wizard went once more to his\\r\\nsatchel—which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds and\\r\\nends—and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which they\\r\\nmanaged to fasten four of the wings to Jim\\'s harness, two near his head\\r\\nand two near his tail. They were a bit wiggley, but secure enough if\\r\\nonly the harness held together.\\nThe other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,\\r\\nfor the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as it\\r\\nflew through the air.[Pg 157]\\n\\n\\nJIM FLUTTERED AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH THE AIR.\\n\\n[Pg 158]\\nThese preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but the\\r\\nsleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soon\\r\\nsome of them would be hunting for their missing wings. So the prisoners\\r\\nresolved to leave their prison at once.\\nThey mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap. The\\r\\ngirl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each side\\r\\nof her. When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:\\n\"Fly away, Jim!\"\\n\"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly.\\n\"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard.\\n\"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse.\\n\"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb. \"Just\\r\\nyou light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don\\'t waste any time\\r\\nabout it, either.\"\\nSo the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flew\\r\\naway from the platform. Dorothy was a little anxious about the success\\r\\nof their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out his\\r\\nbony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough to\\r\\nmake anybody nervous. He groaned, too, as if frightened, and the wings\\r\\ncreaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten[Pg 159] to oil them; but\\r\\nthey kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so that they\\r\\nmade excellent progress from the start. The only thing that anyone could\\r\\ncomplain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up and\\r\\nthen down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as the\\r\\nair could make it.\\nThe main point, however, was that they flew, and flew swiftly, if a bit\\r\\nunevenly, toward the rock for which they had headed.\\nSome of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time in\\r\\ncollecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothy\\r\\nhappened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almost\\r\\ndarkened the sky.\\n[Pg 160]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 13.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE DEN OF THE DRAGONETTES\\n\\nUR friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for with\\r\\ntheir eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles. All\\r\\nthe way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when Jim\\r\\nfinally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still some\\r\\ndistance away.\\n\"But, I\\'m afraid they\\'ll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited.\\n\"No; we must stop them,\" declared the Wizard. \"Quick Zeb, help me pull\\r\\noff these wooden wings!\"\\nThey tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and the\\r\\nWizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern.\\r\\nThen he poured over them[Pg 161] all the kerosene oil that was left in his\\r\\noil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile.\\nThe flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar and\\r\\ncrackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived. The\\r\\ncreatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for such\\r\\na dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the\\r\\nhistory of their wooden land.\\nInside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms built\\r\\ninto the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors from\\r\\ntheir hinges and tossed them all on the flames.\\n\"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,\\r\\nsmiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of their\\r\\nstratagem. \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserable\\r\\nwooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and the\\r\\nGargoyles never will be missed. But come, my children; let us explore\\r\\nthe mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from\\r\\nthis cavern, which is getting to be almost as hot as a bake-oven.\"\\nTo their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flight\\r\\nof steps by means of which they could mount to the earth\\'s surface. A\\r\\nsort of inclined tunnel led upward[Pg 162] for a way, and they found the floor\\r\\nof it both rough and steep. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow\\r\\ngallery where the buggy could not pass. This delayed and bothered them\\r\\nfor a while, because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them.\\r\\nIt carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were\\r\\ngood roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels\\r\\nthey felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set to\\r\\nwork and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggy\\r\\nedgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. In this position they\\r\\nmanaged, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehicle\\r\\nthrough the narrow part of the passage. It was not a great distance,\\r\\nfortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together\\r\\nagain and proceeded more comfortably. But the road was nothing more than\\r\\na series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in\\r\\nevery direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled\\r\\nas to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when\\r\\nthey had started, hours before.\\n\"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we\\'ve \\'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that\\'s\\r\\none comfort!\"\\n[Pg 163][Pg 164]\\n\\n\\n\"WHY IT\\'S A DRAGON!\"\\n\\n\"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire,\"\\r\\nreturned the Wizard. \"But even if they succeeded[Pg 165] in doing that it\\r\\nwould be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I am\\r\\nsure we need fear them no longer.\"\\nOnce in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which made\\r\\nthe way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the lanterns\\r\\nto give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they were\\r\\nable to jump over them. Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose\\r\\nrock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy. At such times Dorothy,\\r\\nZeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over the\\r\\nroughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going.\\r\\nBut the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, on\\r\\nturning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave\\r\\narching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor.\\nThe cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the\\r\\nground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always\\r\\nside by side. These were motionless at first, but soon began to flicker\\r\\nmore brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down.\\n\"What sort of a place is this?\" asked the boy, trying to see more\\r\\nclearly through the gloom.\\n\"I cannot imagine, I\\'m sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about.\\n\"Woogh!\" snarled Eureka, arching her back until her[Pg 166] hair stood straight\\r\\non end; \"it\\'s a den of alligators, or crocodiles, or some other dreadful\\r\\ncreatures! Don\\'t you see their terrible eyes?\"\\n\"Eureka sees better in the dark than we can,\" whispered Dorothy. \"Tell\\r\\nus, dear, what do the creatures look like?\" she asked, addressing her\\r\\npet.\\n\"I simply can\\'t describe \\'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering. \"Their\\r\\neyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But their\\r\\nbodies don\\'t seem very big.\"\\n\"Where are they?\" enquired the girl.\\n\"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern. Oh,\\r\\nDorothy—you can\\'t imagine what horrid things they are! They\\'re uglier\\r\\nthan the Gargoyles.\"\\n\"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a rasping\\r\\nvoice near by. \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-looking\\r\\ncreatures yourselves, and I\\'m sure mother has often told us we were the\\r\\nloveliest and prettiest things in all the world.\"\\nHearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,\\r\\nand the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of\\r\\nthe little pockets in the rock.\\n\"Why, it\\'s a dragon!\" he exclaimed.\\n\"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at\\r\\nthem so steadily; \"you are wrong about that.[Pg 167] We hope to grow to be\\r\\ndragons some day, but just now we\\'re only dragonettes.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley head,\\r\\nthe yawning mouth and the big eyes.\\n\"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves real\\r\\ndragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply. \"The big dragons\\r\\nare very proud, and don\\'t think children amount to much; but mother says\\r\\nthat some day we will all be very powerful and important.\"\\n\"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around.\\n\"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner. If she\\r\\nhas good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of rhinoceri, or\\r\\nperhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger.\"\\n\"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back.\\n\"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws.\\n\"And—and—do you eat people?\"\\n\"To be sure, when we can get them. But they\\'ve been very scarce for a\\r\\nfew years and we usually have to be content with elephants or\\r\\nbuffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone.\\n\"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as if\\r\\nfascinated.[Pg 168]\\n\"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters that\\r\\nyou see here are practically my own age. If I remember rightly, we were\\r\\nsixty-six years old the day before yesterday.\"\\n\"But that isn\\'t young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement.\\n\"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish.\"\\n\"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Mother\\'s about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track of\\r\\nher age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds. She\\'s a little\\r\\nfussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and still in\\r\\nher prime.\"\\n\"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment\\'s\\r\\nthought, she asked: \"Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be good\\r\\nto us, or do you intend to eat us?\"\\n\"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; but\\r\\nunfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back\\r\\nof our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you. If you\\r\\nchoose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink; but\\r\\nunless you do you will remain quite safe.\"\\nThere was a regretful accent in the creature\\'s voice, and at the words\\r\\nall the other dragonettes sighed dismally.[Pg 169]\\nDorothy felt relieved. Presently she asked:\\n\"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"\\n\"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, and\\r\\nif we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with\\r\\neach other and get into a lot of mischief. Mother usually knows what she\\r\\nis about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to escape\\r\\nus unless you come too near, and you probably won\\'t do that.\"\\n\"No, indeed!\" said the little girl. \"We don\\'t wish to be eaten by such\\r\\nawful beasts.\"\\n\"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are rather\\r\\nimpolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults.\\r\\nWe consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance, for mother has told\\r\\nus so, and she knows. And we are of an excellent family and have a\\r\\npedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back about\\r\\ntwenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon of\\r\\nAtlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created. Can\\r\\nyou match that pedigree, little girl?\"\\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guess\\r\\nthat\\'s being just as \\'spectable and haughty as living in a cave with\\r\\nyour tail tied to a rock. If it isn\\'t I\\'ll have to stand it, that\\'s\\r\\nall.\"\\n\"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly droop[Pg 170]ing its scaley\\r\\neyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons.\\nBeing reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of\\r\\ntheir rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to examine\\r\\nthem more closely. The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels\\r\\nand covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under the\\r\\nlight of the lanterns. Their front legs, which grew just back of their\\r\\nheads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were smaller around\\r\\nthan their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tails\\r\\nwere slim as a shoe-string. Dorothy thought, if it had taken them\\r\\nsixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully a hundred\\r\\nyears more before they could hope to call themselves dragons, and that\\r\\nseemed like a good while to wait to grow up.\\n\"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of this\\r\\nplace before the mother dragon comes back.\"\\n\"Don\\'t hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad to\\r\\nmeet you, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we\\'re a little particular\\r\\nabout associating with strangers. Will you kindly tell us which way your\\r\\nmother went to get on top the earth?\"\\n\"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another[Pg 171] dragonette.\\r\\n\"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if we\\r\\ntold you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished.\"\\n\"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can.\"\\nThey circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away from\\r\\nthe blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discovered\\r\\nthat there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the place\\r\\nwhere they had entered. They selected one of these at a venture and\\r\\nhurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when the\\r\\nmother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her\\r\\nacquaintance.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 172]\\n\\nChapter 14.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsOZMA USES THE MAGIC BELT\\n\\nOR a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentle\\r\\nincline, and the wanderers made such good progress that they grew\\r\\nhopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute. But\\r\\nat length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the\\r\\npassage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther.\\nThis rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,\\r\\nturning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot. When first they\\r\\ncame to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it revolved\\r\\nuntil there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the other side.\\r\\nThis appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to[Pg 173] take\\r\\nadvantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing around\\r\\nagain before they had decided to pass over. But they knew now that there\\r\\nwas a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appeared\\r\\nfor the second time.\\nThe children and the Wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang\\r\\ninto the passage beyond, landing safely though a little out of breath.\\r\\nJim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; for\\r\\njust as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swung\\r\\nacross it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fell\\r\\ninto the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there.\\nThey heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-table\\r\\ncame to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from\\r\\nwhich they had come.\\n\"Never mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don\\'t want to get back, anyhow.\"\\n\"I\\'m not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"The mother dragon may come\\r\\ndown and catch us here.\"\\n\"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path she\\r\\nusually takes. But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not see\\r\\nany signs of so large a beast having passed through it.\"[Pg 174]\\n\"Then we\\'re all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the other\\r\\nway she can\\'t poss\\'bly get to us now.\"\\n\"Of course not, my dear. But there is another thing to consider. The\\r\\nmother dragon probably knows the road to the earth\\'s surface, and if she\\r\\nwent the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the Wizard,\\r\\nthoughtfully.\\n\"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"That would be unlucky, wouldn\\'t it?\"\\n\"Very. Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" said\\r\\nZeb. \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I\\'ll be glad it isn\\'t\\r\\nthe way the dragon goes.\"\\n\"So will I,\" returned Dorothy. \"It\\'s enough to have your pedigree flung\\r\\nin your face by those saucy dragonettes. No one knows what the mother\\r\\nmight do.\"\\nThey now moved on again, creeping slowly up another steep incline. The\\r\\nlanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remaining\\r\\noil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer.\\r\\nBut their journey was almost over, for in a short time they reached a\\r\\nsmall cave from which there was no further outlet.\\nThey did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts were\\r\\ngladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack\\r\\nin the roof of the cave, far overhead. That meant that their world—the\\r\\nreal world—was[Pg 175] not very far away, and that the succession of perilous\\r\\nadventures they had encountered had at last brought them near the\\r\\nearth\\'s surface, which meant home to them. But when the adventurers\\r\\nlooked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in a\\r\\nstrong prison from which there was no hope of escape.\\n\"But we\\'re almost on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is the\\r\\nsun—the most beau\\'ful sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly at\\r\\nthe crack in the distant roof.\\n\"Almost on earth isn\\'t being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontented\\r\\ntone. \"It wouldn\\'t be possible for even me to get up to that crack—or\\r\\nthrough it if I got there.\"\\n\"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily.\\n\"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle of\\r\\nperplexity.\\n\"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the old\\r\\ncab-horse. \"Folks don\\'t fall into the middle of the earth and then get\\r\\nback again to tell of their adventures—not in real life. And the whole\\r\\nthing has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talk\\r\\nyour language, and to understand the words you say.\"\\n\"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don\\'t forget them,\\r\\nfor I may have to eat them, after all.\"[Pg 176]\\n\"I\\'ve heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came of\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with no\\r\\nway of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously.\\n\"No,\" answered Dorothy. \"But don\\'t you lose heart, Jim, for I\\'m sure\\r\\nthis isn\\'t the end of our story, by any means.\"\\nThe reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not\\r\\nenjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in his\\r\\npocket. So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the piglets\\r\\nout one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased.\\n\"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I\\'m afraid I\\'ve got you into a lot of\\r\\ntrouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy\\r\\ncave.\"\\n\"What\\'s wrong?\" asked a piglet. \"We\\'ve been in the dark quite a while,\\r\\nand you may as well explain what has happened.\"\\nThe Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers.\\n\"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not?\"\\n\"I am,\" replied the little man.[Pg 177]\\n\"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared the\\r\\ntiny one, with much confidence.\\n\"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly.\\r\\n\"But I\\'m not, my piggy-wees; I\\'m a humbug wizard.\"\\n\"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together.\\n\"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone.\\n\"It\\'s true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly. \"Our friend Oz is\\r\\nmerely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me. He can do several\\r\\nvery wonderful things—if he knows how. But he can\\'t wiz a single thing\\r\\nif he hasn\\'t the tools and machinery to work with.\"\\n\"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,\\r\\ngratefully. \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I\\'m not, is a\\r\\nslander I will not tamely submit to. But I am one of the greatest humbug\\r\\nwizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have all\\r\\nstarved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of this\\r\\nlonely cave.\"\\n\"I don\\'t believe we\\'ll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"\\r\\nremarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought. \"But I\\'m not going to\\r\\nscatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob\\'ly need\\r\\nyours, too.\"\\n\"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard.[Pg 178]\\n\"We may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there are\\r\\nothers who can do more than we can. Cheer up, friends. I\\'m sure Ozma\\r\\nwill help us.\"\\n\"Ozma!\" exclaimed the Wizard. \"Who is Ozma?\"\\n\"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"She\\'s a\\r\\nfriend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and went\\r\\nto Oz with her.\"\\n\"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest.\\n\"Yes. The first time I went to Oz I found you there, ruling the Emerald\\r\\nCity. After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got back to\\r\\nKansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes.\"\\n\"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding. \"They once\\r\\nbelonged to the Wicked Witch. Have you them here with you?\"\\n\"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child. \"But the\\r\\nsecond time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt,\\r\\nwhich is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes.\"\\n\"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened with\\r\\ngreat interest.\\n\"Ozma has it; for its powers won\\'t work in a common, ordinary country\\r\\nlike the United States. Anyone in a fairy[Pg 179] country like the Land of Oz\\r\\ncan do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,\\r\\nwho used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry.\"\\n\"And were you?\" asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard.\\n\"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hanging\\r\\nin her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may\\r\\nbe, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: \\'I wonder what\\r\\nSo-and-so is doing,\\' and at once the picture shows where her friend is\\r\\nand what the friend is doing. That\\'s real magic, Mr. Wizard; isn\\'t it?\\r\\nWell, every day at four o\\'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in that\\r\\npicture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign and\\r\\nshe will put on the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt and wish me to be with her in\\r\\nOz.\"\\n\"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchanted\\r\\npicture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb.\\n\"Of course; when it is four o\\'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at his\\r\\nstartled expression.\\n\"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"\\r\\ncontinued the boy.\\n\"That\\'s it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt.\"\\n\"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I am\\r\\nvery glad of it. The rest of us will die[Pg 180] much more cheerfully when we\\r\\nknow you have escaped our sad fate.\"\\n\"I won\\'t die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten. \"There\\'s nothing\\r\\ncheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat has\\r\\nnine lives, and so must die nine times.\"\\n\"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy.\\n\"No, and I\\'m not anxious to begin,\" said Eureka.\\n\"Don\\'t worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I\\'ll hold you in my arms, and\\r\\ntake you with me.\"\\n\"Take us, too!\" cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath.\\n\"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy. \"I\\'ll try.\"\\n\"Couldn\\'t you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse.\\nDorothy laughed.\\n\"I\\'ll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save you\\r\\nall, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"\\n\"How?\" they asked.\\n\"By using the Magic Belt. All I need do is to wish you with me, and\\r\\nthere you\\'ll be—safe in the royal palace!\"\\n\"Good!\" cried Zeb.\\n\"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,\\r\\nin a thoughtful tone, \"and I\\'d like to[Pg 181] see them again, for I was very\\r\\nhappy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins.\"\\n\"Who are they?\" asked the boy.\\n\"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"I wonder\\r\\nif they would treat me nicely if I went there again.\"\\n\"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy. \"They are still proud of their\\r\\nformer Wizard, and often speak of you kindly.\"\\n\"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and the\\r\\nScarecrow?\" he enquired.\\n\"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people.\"\\n\"And the Cowardly Lion?\"\\n\"Oh, he lives there too, with his friend the Hungry Tiger; and Billina\\r\\nis there, because she liked the place better than Kansas, and wouldn\\'t\\r\\ngo with me to Australia.\"\\n\"I\\'m afraid I don\\'t know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the Wizard,\\r\\nshaking his head. \"Is Billina a girl?\"\\n\"No; she\\'s a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine. You\\'re sure to like\\r\\nBillina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy.\\n\"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb,[Pg 182] uneasily.\\r\\n\"Couldn\\'t you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"\\n\"Don\\'t worry,\" replied the girl. \"You\\'ll just love the folks in Oz, when\\r\\nyou get acquainted. What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"\\nThe little man looked at his watch—a big silver one that he carried in\\r\\nhis vest pocket.\\n\"Half-past three,\" he said.\\n\"Then we must wait for half an hour,\" she continued; \"but it won\\'t take\\r\\nlong, after that, to carry us all to the Emerald City.\"\\nThey sat silently thinking for a time. Then Jim suddenly asked:\\n\"Are there any horses in Oz?\"\\n\"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he\\'s a sawhorse.\"\\n\"A what?\"\\n\"A sawhorse. Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a witch-powder,\\r\\nwhen she was a boy.\"\\n\"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly.\\n\"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom.\\r\\nBut she\\'s a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all the\\r\\nworld.\"\\n\"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff.[Pg 183]\\n\"It is when it\\'s not alive,\" acknowledged the girl. \"But this sawhorse\\r\\ncan trot as fast as you can, Jim; and he\\'s very wise, too.\"\\n\"Pah! I\\'ll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\" cried\\r\\nthe cab-horse.\\nDorothy did not reply to that. She felt that Jim would know more about\\r\\nthe Saw-Horse later on.\\nThe time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally the\\r\\nWizard announced that four o\\'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught up\\r\\nthe kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to the\\r\\nfar-away, invisible Ozma.\\n\"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully.\\n\"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl.\\nShe had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from the\\r\\ncave, and with her went the kitten. There had been no sound of any kind\\r\\nand no warning. One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten in\\r\\nher lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and the\\r\\nboy were all that remained in the underground prison.[Pg 184]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY MADE THE SIGNAL.\\n\\n\"I believe we will soon follow her,\" announced the Wizard, in a tone of\\r\\ngreat relief; \"for I know something about[Pg 185] the magic of the fairyland\\r\\nthat is called the Land of Oz. Let us be ready, for we may be sent for\\r\\nany minute.\"\\nHe put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and Zeb\\r\\ngot into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat.\\n\"Will it hurt?\" asked the boy, in a voice that trembled a little.\\n\"Not at all,\" replied the Wizard. \"It will all happen as quick as a\\r\\nwink.\"\\nAnd that was the way it did happen.\\nThe cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to make\\r\\nsure he was not asleep. For they were in the streets of a beautiful\\r\\nemerald-green city, bathed in a grateful green light that was especially\\r\\npleasing to their eyes, and surrounded by merry faced people in gorgeous\\r\\ngreen-and-gold costumes of many extraordinary designs.\\nBefore them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, and\\r\\nnow the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard,\\r\\nwhere splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot their\\r\\nsilvery sprays into the air.\\nZeb shook the reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of amazement,\\r\\nfor the people were beginning to gather around and stare at the\\r\\nstrangers.[Pg 186]\\n\"Gid-dap!\" cried the boy, and at the word Jim slowly trotted into the\\r\\ncourtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the great\\r\\nentrance of the royal palace.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 187]\\n\\nCHAPTER 15.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsOLD FRIENDS ARE REUNITED\\n\\nANY servants dressed in handsome uniforms stood ready to welcome the\\r\\nnew arrivals, and when the Wizard got out of the buggy a pretty girl in\\r\\na green gown cried out in surprise:\\n\"Why, it\\'s Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, come back again!\"\\nThe little man looked at her closely and then took both the maiden\\'s\\r\\nhands in his and shook them cordially.\\n\"On my word,\" he exclaimed, \"it\\'s little Jellia Jamb—as pert and pretty\\r\\nas ever!\"\\n\"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low. \"But I\\'m afraid you\\r\\ncannot rule the Emerald City, as you used to, because we now have a\\r\\nbeautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly.\"[Pg 188]\\n\"And the people will not willingly part with her,\" added a tall soldier\\r\\nin a Captain-General\\'s uniform.\\nThe Wizard turned to look at him.\\n\"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked.\\n\"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since then\\r\\nI have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the Royal\\r\\nArmies.\"\\n\"That\\'s nice,\" said the little man. \"But I assure you, my good people,\\r\\nthat I do not wish to rule the Emerald City,\" he added, earnestly.\\n\"In that case you are very welcome!\" cried all the servants, and it\\r\\npleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainers\\r\\nbowed before him. His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz, by\\r\\nany means.\\n\"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy and\\r\\nstood beside his friend the little Wizard.\\n\"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"\\r\\nreplied Jellia Jamb. \"But she has ordered me to make you welcome and to\\r\\nshow you to your apartments.\"\\nThe boy looked around him with wondering eyes. Such magnificence and\\r\\nwealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamed\\r\\nof, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was real\\r\\nand not tinsel.[Pg 189]\\n\"What\\'s to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily. He had seen\\r\\nconsiderable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew that\\r\\nthis regal palace was no place for him.\\nIt perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with the\\r\\nanimal. The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so unusual\\r\\na creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who lived in\\r\\nthe Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so after\\r\\ninspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes the\\r\\ngirl decided not to be afraid of him.\\n\"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have been\\r\\nbuilt since I went away.\"\\n\"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorse\\r\\nlives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural in\\r\\nappearance than this great beast you have brought with you.\"\\n\"Do you mean that I\\'m a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily.\\n\"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in the\\r\\nplace you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual.\"\\nThis mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maiden\\r\\ndecided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big building\\r\\nhaving many rooms that were seldom in use.[Pg 190]\\nSo Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horse\\r\\naround to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he\\r\\ncould have all to himself.\\nThen Jellia said to the Wizard:\\n\"Your own room—which was back of the great Throne Room—has been vacant\\r\\never since you left us. Would you like it again?\"\\n\"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man. \"It will seem like being at home\\r\\nagain, for I lived in that room for many, many years.\"\\nHe knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his satchel.\\r\\nZeb was also escorted to a room—so grand and beautiful that he almost\\r\\nfeared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he might dim their\\r\\nsplendor. In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of rich\\r\\nvelvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told him to dress\\r\\nhimself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared to\\r\\ndine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour\\'s time.\\nOpening from the chamber was a fine bath-room having a marble tub with\\r\\nperfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of his\\r\\nsurroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvet\\r\\ncostume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much worn\\r\\nclothing. There[Pg 191] were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with\\r\\ndiamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fully\\r\\ndressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in\\r\\nhis life.\\nHe was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence of\\r\\nthe Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more\\r\\ndainty and attractive than it was splendid. Here he found Dorothy seated\\r\\nbeside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped\\r\\nsuddenly with a gasp of admiration.\\nBut Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend\\'s hand, drawing him\\r\\nimpulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously upon\\r\\nher guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the boy\\'s\\r\\nembarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with many\\r\\nsparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head and\\r\\nwrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive.\\nOzma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the\\r\\nEmerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkies\\r\\ninto one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner table\\r\\nthe Princess said:\\n\"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called your[Pg 192]self Oz after this\\r\\ngreat country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you.\\r\\nIt is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because you are\\r\\nof a strange race and my own name is Ozma. No one, I am sure, is better\\r\\nable to explain this mystery than you.\"\\n\"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give me\\r\\npleasure to explain my connection with your country. In the first place,\\r\\nI must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was a\\r\\npolitician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle\\r\\nEmmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he could\\r\\nthink of no more to go before it. Taken altogether, it was a dreadfully\\r\\nlong name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of the hardest\\r\\nlessons I ever learned was to remember my own name. When I grew up I\\r\\njust called myself O. Z., because the other initials were P-I-N-H-E-A-D;\\r\\nand that spelled \\'pinhead,\\' which was a reflection on my intelligence.\"\\n\"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,\\r\\nsympathetically. \"But didn\\'t you cut it almost too short?\"\\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard. \"When a young man I ran away from home\\r\\nand joined a circus. I used to call myself a Wizard, and do tricks of\\r\\nventriloquism.\"\\n\"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess.[Pg 193]\\n\"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that the\\r\\nobject was speaking instead of me. Also I began to make balloon\\r\\nascensions. On my balloon and on all the other articles I used in the\\r\\ncircus I painted the two initials: \\'O. Z.\\', to show that those things\\r\\nbelonged to me.\\n\"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts\\r\\nto this beautiful country. When the people saw me come from the sky they\\r\\nnaturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. I\\r\\ntold them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazed\\r\\nthem; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they called\\r\\nme Oz.\"\\n\"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling.\\n\"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup while\\r\\ntalking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one of\\r\\nthe four being ruled by a Witch. But the people thought my power was\\r\\ngreater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought so\\r\\ntoo, for they never dared oppose me. I ordered the Emerald City to be\\r\\nbuilt just where the four countries cornered together, and when it was\\r\\ncompleted I announced myself the Ruler of the Land of Oz, which included\\r\\nall the four countries of the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and\\r\\nthe Quadlings. Over this Land I ruled in peace for many years,[Pg 194] until I\\r\\ngrew old and longed to see my native city once again. So when Dorothy\\r\\nwas first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away with\\r\\nher in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me back\\r\\nalone. After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to find that all my\\r\\nold friends were dead or had moved away. So, having nothing else to do,\\r\\nI joined a circus again, and made my balloon ascensions until the\\r\\nearthquake caught me.\"\\n\"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little more\\r\\nhistory about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understand—perhaps\\r\\nfor the reason that no one ever told it you. Many years before you came\\r\\nhere this Land was united under one Ruler, as it is now, and the Ruler\\'s\\r\\nname was always \\'Oz\\', which means in our language \\'Great and Good\\'; or,\\r\\nif the Ruler happened to be a woman, her name was always \\'Ozma.\\' But\\r\\nonce upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king and\\r\\nrule the four parts of the kingdom themselves; so when the Ruler, my\\r\\ngrandfather, was hunting one day, one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole him\\r\\nand carried him away, keeping him a close prisoner. Then the Witches\\r\\ndivided up the kingdom, and ruled the four parts of it until you came\\r\\nhere. That was why the people were so glad to see you, and why they\\r\\nthought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler.\"[Pg 195]\\n\"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two Good\\r\\nWitches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land.\"\\n\"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in the\\r\\nNorth and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South. But\\r\\nMombi was still my grandfather\\'s jailor, and afterward my father\\'s\\r\\njailor. When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that no\\r\\none would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess of\\r\\nthe Land of Oz. But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of my\\r\\npeople.\"\\n\"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will consider\\r\\nme one of your most faithful and devoted subjects.\"\\n\"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,\\r\\n\"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City.\"\\n\"Your people built it,\" he answered. \"I only bossed the job, as we say\\r\\nin Omaha.\"\\n\"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and made\\r\\nthe people proud of your magical art. So, as you are now too old to\\r\\nwander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long as\\r\\nyou live. You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be treated\\r\\nwith every respect and consideration.\"[Pg 196]\\n\"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the little\\r\\nman said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that tear-drops were\\r\\nstanding in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure a\\r\\nhome like this.\\n\"He\\'s only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him.\\n\"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,\\r\\npromptly.\\n\"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, who\\r\\nwas now feeling more at ease.\\n\"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess. \"I have\\r\\nsent messengers to summon all of Dorothy\\'s old friends to meet her and\\r\\ngive her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now.\"\\nIndeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,\\r\\nto hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see\\r\\nher again. The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man,\\r\\nwho was an important personage in the Land of Oz.\\n\"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped the\\r\\nsoft, stuffed hands of his old friend.\\n\"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"I\\'m very certain, Oz, that\\r\\nyou gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them day\\r\\nand night, when all other brains are fast asleep.\"[Pg 197]\\n\\n\\nDOROTHY AND OZMA.\\n\\n[Pg 198]\\n\"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was the\\r\\nnext question.\\n\"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur. But\\r\\nOzma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and after[Pg 199]\\r\\nthat I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"\\nJust then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threw\\r\\nopen the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in. Dorothy sprang\\r\\nforward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the same\\r\\ntime a glad cry.\\n\"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you\\'ve grown.\"\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice. \"I live on\\r\\nthe fat of the land—don\\'t I, Ozma?\"\\n\"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess.\\nAround Billina\\'s neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legs\\r\\nwere bracelets of emeralds. She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothy\\'s\\r\\nlap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with a\\r\\nsharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow. But the little girl\\r\\ngave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down again\\r\\nwithout daring to scratch.\\n\"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy. \"Is that the way to treat my\\r\\nfriends?\"[Pg 200]\\n\"You have queer friends, seems to me,\" replied the kitten, in a surly\\r\\ntone.\\n\"Seems to me the same way,\" said Billina, scornfully, \"if that beastly\\r\\ncat is one of them.\"\\n\"Look here!\" said Dorothy, sternly. \"I won\\'t have any quarrelling in the\\r\\nLand of Oz, I can tell you! Everybody lives in peace here, and loves\\r\\neverybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up and be\\r\\nfriends, I\\'ll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,\\r\\nimmejitly. So, there!\"\\nThey were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to be\\r\\ngood. But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends, for\\r\\nall of that.\\nAnd now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifully\\r\\nnickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of the\\r\\nroom. The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed with joy\\r\\nthe return of the little old Wizard.\\n\"Sir,\" said he to the latter, \"I never can thank you enough for the\\r\\nexcellent heart you once gave me. It has made me many friends, I assure\\r\\nyou, and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it ever did.\"\\n\"I\\'m glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard. \"I was afraid it would get\\r\\nmoldy in that tin body of yours.\"[Pg 201]\\n\"Not at all,\" returned Nick Chopper. \"It keeps finely, being preserved\\r\\nin my air-tight chest.\"\\nZeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; but\\r\\nthey were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very\\r\\nmuch, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen. But he became\\r\\nnervous again when the next visitor was announced.\\n\"This,\" said Princess Ozma, \"is my friend Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.,\\r\\nwho assisted me one time when I was in great distress, and is now the\\r\\nDean of the Royal College of Athletic Science.\"\\n\"Ah,\" said the Wizard; \"I\\'m pleased to meet so distinguished a\\r\\npersonage.\"\\n\"H. M.,\" said the Woggle-Bug, pompously, \"means Highly Magnified; and T.\\r\\nE. means Thoroughly Educated. I am, in reality, a very big bug, and\\r\\ndoubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain.\"\\n\"How well you disguise it,\" said the Wizard. \"But I don\\'t doubt your\\r\\nword in the least.\"\\n\"Nobody doubts it, sir,\" replied the Woggle-Bug, and drawing a book from\\r\\nits pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and sat\\r\\ndown in a corner to read.\\nNobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite in\\r\\none less thoroughly educated; so they[Pg 202] straightway forgot him and joined\\r\\nin a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-time\\r\\narrived.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 203]\\n\\nCHAPTER 16.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsJIM, THE CAB-HORSE\\n\\nIM the Cab-horse found himself in possession of a large room with a\\r\\ngreen marble floor and carved marble wainscoting, which was so stately\\r\\nin its appearance that it would have awed anyone else. Jim accepted it\\r\\nas a mere detail, and at his command the attendants gave his coat a good\\r\\nrubbing, combed his mane and tail, and washed his hoofs and fetlocks.\\r\\nThen they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied that\\r\\nthey could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience. First they\\r\\nbrought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay.\\n\"Take that stuff away!\" he commanded. \"Do you take me for a\\r\\nsalamander?\"[Pg 204]\\nThey obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silver\\r\\nplatter, with drawn gravey poured over it.\\n\"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff. \"Do you take me for a tom-cat? Away\\r\\nwith it!\"\\nThe servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a great\\r\\ntray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast.\\n\"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. \"Do you take me\\r\\nfor a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, and\\r\\nwhat dreadful things you feed upon! Is there nothing that is decent to\\r\\neat in this palace?\"\\nThe trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste and\\r\\nsaid:\\n\"What would your Highness like for dinner?\"\\n\"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles.\\n\"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any other\\r\\nanimal in this country,\" said the Steward.\\n\"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\" declared the horse.\\n\"Oats? We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with much\\r\\ndefference. \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cook\\r\\nfor breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly.[Pg 205]\\n\"I\\'ll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim. \"Fetch it on, but don\\'t cook it,\\r\\nas you value your life.\"\\nYou see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a little\\r\\narrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treated\\r\\notherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrival\\r\\nin the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal\\'s\\r\\nill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, and\\r\\nJim ate it with much relish.\\nThen the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse\\r\\nslept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.\\nIn the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walk\\r\\nand try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly through[Pg 206]\\r\\nthe handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,\\r\\nwherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse.\\nJim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed. The Sawhorse stopped at\\r\\nthe same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes,\\r\\nwhich were mere knots in the log that formed its body. The legs of the\\r\\nSawhorse were four sticks driven into holes bored in the log; its tail\\r\\nwas a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a place\\r\\nchopped in one end of the body which pro[Pg 207]jected a little and served as\\r\\na head. The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold,\\r\\nand the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of red leather set with\\r\\nsparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy body.\\n\\n\\n\"FOR GOODNESS SAKE, WHAT SORT OF A BEING ARE YOU?\"\\n\\nJim\\'s eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared at\\r\\nthe creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it\\r\\nrested against his arched neck.\\nIn this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each other\\r\\nfor a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing might\\r\\nbe which it now beheld for the first time. Then Jim exclaimed:\\n\"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"\\n\"I\\'m a Sawhorse,\" replied the other.\\n\"Oh; I believe I\\'ve heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you are\\r\\nunlike anything that I expected to see.\"\\n\"I do not doubt it,\" the Sawhorse observed, with a tone of pride. \"I am\\r\\nconsidered quite unusual.\"\\n\"You are, indeed. But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to be\\r\\nalive.\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen. \"Ozma\\r\\nsprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live. I know I\\'m not\\r\\nmuch account; but I\\'m the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so they\\r\\ntreat me with great respect.\"[Pg 208]\\n\"You, a horse!\"\\n\"Oh, not a real one, of course. There are no real horses here at all.\\r\\nBut I\\'m a splendid imitation of one.\"\\nJim gave an indignant neigh.\\n\"Look at me!\" he cried. \"Behold a real horse!\"\\nThe wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently.\\n\"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured.\\n\"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by the\\r\\nimpression he had created. \"It is proved by my fine points. For example,\\r\\nlook at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away the\\r\\nflies.\"\\n\"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse.\\n\"And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass.\"\\n\"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Saw-horse.\\n\"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, full\\r\\nbreaths,\" said Jim, proudly.\\n\"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other.\\n\"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. \"You\\r\\ndo not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, nor\\r\\nthe delight of eating delicious[Pg 209] food, nor the satisfaction of drawing a\\r\\nlong breath of fresh, pure air. You may be an imitation of a horse, but\\r\\nyou\\'re a mighty poor one.\"\\n\"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse. \"But I am\\r\\nglad to meet at last a Real Horse. You are certainly the most beautiful\\r\\ncreature I ever beheld.\"\\nThis praise won Jim completely. To be called beautiful was a novelty in\\r\\nhis experience. Said he:\\n\"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that I\\r\\nsuppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh and\\r\\nblood and bones.\"\\n\"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they are\\r\\nadmirable and distinct. Also I can see the flesh. But the blood, I\\r\\nsuppose, is tucked away inside.\"\\n\"Exactly,\" said Jim.\\n\"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse.\\nJim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that.\\n\"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where I\\r\\nam cut. You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt.\"\\n\"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse. \"Once in a while I get broken\\r\\nup some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again. And I\\r\\nnever feel a break or a splinter in the least.\"[Pg 210]\\nJim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feel\\r\\npain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided he\\r\\nwould not change places with it under any circumstances.\\n\"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked.\\n\"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs from\\r\\nwearing out. We\\'ve had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I, and\\r\\nshe likes me.\"\\nThe cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a\\r\\nneigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf. For around the corner\\r\\nhad come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they were\\r\\nupon him before he was aware of their presence. Jim was in the act of\\r\\nplunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:\\n\"Stop, my brother! Stop, Real Horse! These are friends, and will do you\\r\\nno harm.\"\\nJim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lion\\r\\nwith clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and a\\r\\nbody like yellow plush. The other was a great Tiger with purple stripes\\r\\naround his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through the\\r\\nhalf closed lids like coals of fire. The huge forms of these monarchs of\\r\\nthe forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest\\r\\nheart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them.[Pg 211]\\nBut the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying,\\n\"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant\\r\\nKing of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess\\r\\nOzma. And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who longs\\r\\nto devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so.\\r\\nThese royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have come\\r\\nto the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland.\"\\nHearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm. He bowed his head\\r\\nwith as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking\\r\\nbeasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way.\\n\"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorse\\r\\nadmiringly.\\n\"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion. \"In the forest\\r\\nhe would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out and his\\r\\nneck is uselessly long. His joints, I notice, are swollen and overgrown,\\r\\nand he lacks flesh and is old in years.\"\\n\"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice. \"My\\r\\nconscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the Real\\r\\nHorse.\"[Pg 212]\\n\"I\\'m glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and it\\r\\ntells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof.\"\\nIf he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was\\r\\nmistaken. The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly.\\n\"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attend\\r\\nto its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm. Some day I\\r\\nwill let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know more\\r\\nabout tigers than you do now.\"\\n\"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be our\\r\\nfriend, as well. So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and\\r\\nconverse upon more pleasant subjects. Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"\\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jim. \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so if\\r\\nyou will excuse me I will eat now.\"\\n\"He\\'s a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch the\\r\\nclover. \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for nothing\\r\\ncould then tempt me to devour babies and lambs.\"\\nJust then Dorothy, who had risen early and heard the voices of the\\r\\nanimals, ran out to greet her old friends. She hugged both the Lion and\\r\\nthe Tiger with eager delight,[Pg 213] but seemed to love the King of Beasts a\\r\\nlittle better than she did his hungry friend, having known him longer.\\nBy the time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told them\\r\\nall about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures, the breakfast\\r\\nbell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join her\\r\\nhuman comrades. As she entered the great hall a voice called out, in a\\r\\nrather harsh tone:\\n\"What! are you here again?\"\\n\"Yes, I am,\" she answered, looking all around to see where the voice\\r\\ncame from.\\n\"What brought you back?\" was the next question, and Dorothy\\'s eye rested\\r\\non an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace, and\\r\\ncaught its lips in the act of moving.\\n\"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed. \"I thought you were stuffed.\"\\n\"So I am,\" replied the head. \"But once on a time I was part of the Gump,\\r\\nwhich Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life. I was then for a time the\\r\\nHead of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to exist, and we\\r\\ndid many wonderful things. Afterward the Gump was taken apart and I was\\r\\nput back on this wall; but I can still talk when I feel in the mood,\\r\\nwhich is not often.\"[Pg 214]\\n\"It\\'s very strange,\" said the girl. \"What were you when you were first\\r\\nalive?\"\\n\"That I have forgotten,\" replied the Gump\\'s Head, \"and I do not think it\\r\\nis of much importance. But here comes Ozma; so I\\'d better hush up, for\\r\\nthe Princess doesn\\'t like me to chatter since she changed her name from\\r\\nTip to Ozma.\"\\nJust then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothy\\r\\nwith a good-morning kiss. The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy and\\r\\nin good spirits.\\n\"Breakfast is served, dear,\" she said, \"and I am hungry. So don\\'t let us\\r\\nkeep it waiting a single minute.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 215]\\n\\n\\nJIM STOOD TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF.\\n\\n[Pg 216]\\n\\n[Pg 217]\\nCHAPTER 17.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE NINE TINY PIGLETS\\n\\nFTER breakfast Ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to be\\r\\nobserved throughout the Emerald City, in honor of her visitors. The\\r\\npeople had learned that their old Wizard had returned to them and all\\r\\nwere anxious to see him again, for he had always been a rare favorite.\\r\\nSo first there was to be a grand procession through the streets, after\\r\\nwhich the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardries\\r\\nin the great Throne Room of the palace. In the afternoon there were to\\r\\nbe games and races.\\nThe procession was very imposing. First came the Imperial Cornet Band of\\r\\nOz, dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of pea-green satin\\r\\nand buttons of[Pg 218] immense cut emeralds. They played the National air\\r\\ncalled \"The Oz Spangled Banner,\" and behind them were the standard\\r\\nbearers with the Royal flag. This flag was divided into four quarters,\\r\\none being colored sky-blue, another pink, a third lavender and a fourth\\r\\nwhite. In the center was a large emerald-green star, and all over the\\r\\nfour quarters were sewn spangles that glittered beautifully in the\\r\\nsunshine. The colors represented the four countries of Oz, and the green\\r\\nstar the Emerald City.\\nJust behind the royal standard-bearers came the Princess Ozma in her\\r\\nroyal chariot, which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamonds\\r\\nset in exquisite designs. The chariot was drawn on this occasion by the\\r\\nCowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, who were decorated with immense pink\\r\\nand blue bows. In the chariot rode Ozma and Dorothy, the former in\\r\\nsplendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet, while the little Kansas\\r\\ngirl wore around her waist the Magic Belt she had once captured from the\\r\\nNome King.\\nFollowing the chariot came the Scarecrow mounted on the Sawhorse, and\\r\\nthe people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely Ruler.\\r\\nBehind him stalked with regular, jerky steps, the famous machine-man\\r\\ncalled Tik-tok, who had been wound up by Dorothy for the occasion.\\r\\nTik-tok moved by clockwork, and was made all of[Pg 219] burnished copper. He\\r\\nreally belonged to the Kansas girl, who had much respect for his\\r\\nthoughts after they had been properly wound and set going; but as the\\r\\ncopper man would be useless in any place but a fairy country Dorothy had\\r\\nleft him in charge of Ozma, who saw that he was suitably cared for.\\nThere followed another band after this, which was called the Royal Court\\r\\nBand, because the members all lived in the palace. They wore white\\r\\nuniforms with real diamond buttons and played \"What is Oz without Ozma\"\\r\\nvery sweetly.\\nThen came Professor Woggle-Bug, with a group of students from the Royal\\r\\nCollege of Scientific Athletics. The boys wore long hair and striped\\r\\nsweaters and yelled their college yell every other step they took, to\\r\\nthe great satisfaction of the populace, which was glad to have this\\r\\nevidence that their lungs were in good condition.\\nThe brilliantly polished Tin Woodman marched next, at the head of the\\r\\nRoyal Army of Oz which consisted of twenty-eight officers, from Generals\\r\\ndown to Captains. There were no privates in the army because all were so\\r\\ncourageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one until\\r\\nthere were no privates left. Jim and the buggy followed, the old\\r\\ncab-horse being driven by Zeb[Pg 220] while the Wizard stood up on the seat and\\r\\nbowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of the\\r\\npeople, who crowded thick about him.\\nTaken altogether the procession was a grand success, and when it had\\r\\nreturned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great Throne Room\\r\\nto see the Wizard perform his tricks.\\nThe first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet\\r\\nfrom underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two. This\\r\\nact he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible, and\\r\\nthey were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in a\\r\\nvery lively manner. The pretty little creatures would have been a\\r\\nnovelty anywhere, so the people were as amazed and delighted at their\\r\\nappearance as even the Wizard could have desired. When he had made them\\r\\nall disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone, for she\\r\\nwanted one of them to pet and play with. So the Wizard pretended to take\\r\\none of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess (while really he\\r\\nslyly took it from his inside pocket) and Ozma smiled joyously as the\\r\\ncreature nestled in her arms, and she promised to have an emerald collar\\r\\nmade for its fat neck and to keep the little squealer always at hand to\\r\\namuse her.\\nAfterward it was noticed that the Wizard always per[Pg 221]formed his famous\\r\\ntrick with eight piglets, but it seemed to please the people just as\\r\\nwell as if there had been nine of them.\\nIn his little room back of the Throne Room the Wizard had found a lot of\\r\\nthings he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon, for no\\r\\none had occupied the apartment in his absence. There was enough material\\r\\nthere to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learned\\r\\nfrom some of the jugglers in the circus, and he had passed part of the\\r\\nnight in getting them ready. So he followed the trick of the nine tiny\\r\\npiglets with several other wonderful feats that greatly delighted his\\r\\naudience and the people did not seem to care a bit whether the little\\r\\nman was a humbug Wizard or not, so long as he succeeded in amusing them.\\r\\nThey applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance begged\\r\\nhim earnestly not to go away again and leave them.\\n\"In that case,\" said the little man, gravely, \"I will cancel all of my\\r\\nengagements before the crowned heads of Europe and America and devote\\r\\nmyself to the people of Oz, for I love you all so well that I can deny\\r\\nyou nothing.\"\\nAfter the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joined\\r\\nPrincess Ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace, where even the\\r\\nTiger and the Lion were sump[Pg 222]tuously fed and Jim the Cab-horse ate his\\r\\noatmeal out of a golden bowl with seven rows of rubies, sapphires and\\r\\ndiamonds set around the rim of it.\\nIn the afternoon they all went to a great field outside the city gates\\r\\nwhere the games were to be held. There was a beautiful canopy for Ozma\\r\\nand her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump and\\r\\nwrestle. You may be sure the folks of Oz did their best with such a\\r\\ndistinguished company watching them, and finally Zeb offered to wrestle\\r\\nwith a little Munchkin who seemed to be the champion. In appearance he\\r\\nwas twice as old as Zeb, for he had long pointed whiskers and wore a\\r\\npeaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it, which tinkled\\r\\ngaily as he moved. But although the Munchkin was hardly tall enough to\\r\\ncome to Zeb\\'s shoulder he was so strong and clever that he laid the boy\\r\\nthree times on his back with apparent ease.\\nZeb was greatly astonished at his defeat, and when the pretty Princess\\r\\njoined her people in laughing at him he proposed a boxing-match with the\\r\\nMunchkin, to which the little Ozite readily agreed. But the first time\\r\\nthat Zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the Munchkin sat\\r\\ndown upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers,\\r\\nbecause he had been hurt. This made Zeb laugh, in[Pg 223] turn, and the boy\\r\\nfelt comforted to find that Ozma laughed as merrily at her weeping\\r\\nsubject as she had at him.\\nJust then the Scarecrow proposed a race between the Sawhorse and the\\r\\nCab-horse; and although all the others were delighted at the suggestion\\r\\nthe Sawhorse drew back, saying:\\n\"Such a race would not be fair.\"\\n\"Of course not,\" added Jim, with a touch of scorn; \"those little wooden\\r\\nlegs of yours are not half as long as my own.\"\\n\"It isn\\'t that,\" said the Sawhorse, modestly; \"but I never tire, and you\\r\\ndo.\"\\n\"Bah!\" cried Jim, looking with great disdain at the other; \"do you\\r\\nimagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as you\\r\\nare can run as fast as I?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know, I\\'m sure,\" replied the Sawhorse.\\n\"That is what we are trying to find out,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"The\\r\\nobject of a race is to see who can win it—or at least that is what my\\r\\nexcellent brains think.\"\\n\"Once, when I was young,\" said Jim, \"I was a race horse, and defeated\\r\\nall who dared run against me. I was born in Kentucky, you know, where\\r\\nall the best and most aristocratic horses come from.\"\\n\"But you\\'re old, now, Jim,\" suggested Zeb.\\n\"Old! Why, I feel like a colt today,\" replied Jim. \"I only wish there\\r\\nwas a real horse here for me to race with. I\\'d show the people a fine\\r\\nsight, I can tell you.\"[Pg 224]\\n\"Then why not race with the Sawhorse?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\\n\"He\\'s afraid,\" said Jim.\\n\"Oh, no,\" answered the Sawhorse. \"I merely said it wasn\\'t fair. But if\\r\\nmy friend the Real Horse is willing to undertake the race I am quite\\r\\nready.\"\\nSo they unharnessed Jim and took the saddle off the Sawhorse, and the\\r\\ntwo queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start.\\n\"When I say \\'Go!\\'\" Zeb called to them, \"you must dig out and race until\\r\\nyou reach those three trees you see over yonder. Then circle \\'round them\\r\\nand come back again. The first one that passes the place where the\\r\\nPrincess sits shall be named the winner. Are you ready?\"\\n\"I suppose I ought to give the wooden dummy a good start of me,\" growled\\r\\nJim.\\n\"Never mind that,\" said the Sawhorse. \"I\\'ll do the best I can.\"\\n\"Go!\" cried Zeb; and at the word the two horses leaped forward and the\\r\\nrace was begun.\\n[Pg 225][Pg 226][Pg 227]\\n\\n\\nTHE WIZARD TOOK A PIGLET FROM OZMA\\'S HAIR.\\n\\nJim\\'s big hoofs pounded away at a great rate, and although he did not\\r\\nlook very graceful he ran in a way to do credit to his Kentucky\\r\\nbreeding. But the Sawhorse was swifter than the wind. Its wooden legs\\r\\nmoved so fast that[Pg 228] their twinkling could scarcely be seen, and\\r\\nalthough so much smaller than the cab-horse it covered the ground much\\r\\nfaster. Before they had reached the trees the Sawhorse was far ahead,\\r\\nand the wooden animal returned to the starting place and was being\\r\\nlustily cheered by the Ozites before Jim came panting up to the canopy\\r\\nwhere the Princess and her friends were seated.\\n\\n\\nTHE HUNGRY TIGER TEACHES JIM A LESSON.\\n\\nI am sorry to record the fact that Jim was not only ashamed of his\\r\\ndefeat but for a moment lost control of his temper. As he looked at the\\r\\ncomical face of the Sawhorse he imagined that the creature was laughing\\r\\nat him; so in a fit of unreasonable anger he turned around and made a\\r\\nvicious kick that sent his rival tumbling head over heels upon the\\r\\nground, and broke off one of its legs and its left ear.\\nAn instant later the Tiger crouched and launched its huge body through\\r\\nthe air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon. The beast struck\\r\\nJim full on his shoulder and sent the astonished cab-horse rolling over\\r\\nand over, amid shouts of delight from the spectators, who had been\\r\\nhorrified by the ungracious act he had been guilty of.\\nWhen Jim came to himself and sat upon his haunches he found the Cowardly\\r\\nLion crouched on one side of him and the Hungry Tiger on the other, and\\r\\ntheir eyes were glowing like balls of fire.[Pg 229]\\n\"I beg your pardon, I\\'m sure,\" said Jim, meekly. \"I was wrong to kick\\r\\nthe Sawhorse, and I am sorry I became angry at him. He has won the race,\\r\\nand won it fairly; but what can a horse of flesh do against a tireless\\r\\nbeast of wood?\"\\nHearing this apology the Tiger and the Lion stopped lashing their tails\\r\\nand retreated with dignified steps to the side of the Princess.\\n\"No one must injure one of our friends in our presence,\" growled the\\r\\nLion; and Zeb ran to Jim and whispered that unless he controlled his\\r\\ntemper in the future he would probably be torn to pieces.\\nThen the Tin Woodman cut a straight and strong limb from a tree with his\\r\\ngleaming axe and made a new leg and a new ear for the Sawhorse; and when\\r\\nthey had been securely fastened in place Princess Ozma took the coronet\\r\\nfrom her own head and placed it upon that of the winner of the race.\\r\\nSaid she:\\n\"My friend, I reward you for your swiftness by proclaiming you Prince of\\r\\nHorses, whether of wood or of flesh; and hereafter all other horses—in\\r\\nthe Land of Oz, at least—must be considered imitations, and you the\\r\\nreal Champion of your race.\"\\nThere was more applause at this, and then Ozma had the jewelled saddle\\r\\nreplaced upon the Sawhorse and her[Pg 230]self rode the victor back to the city\\r\\nat the head of the grand procession.\\n\"I ought to be a fairy,\" grumbled Jim, as he slowly drew the buggy home;\\r\\n\"for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of no\\r\\naccount whatever. It\\'s no place for us, Zeb.\"\\n\"It\\'s lucky we got here, though,\" said the boy; and Jim thought of the\\r\\ndark cave, and agreed with him.\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 231]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 18.\\nContentsTHE TRIAL OF EUREKA THE KITTEN\\n\\nEVERAL days of festivity and merry-making followed, for such old\\r\\nfriends did not often meet and there was much to be told and talked over\\r\\nbetween them, and many amusements to be enjoyed in this delightful\\r\\ncountry.\\nOzma was happy to have Dorothy beside her, for girls of her own age with\\r\\nwhom it was proper for the Princess to associate were very few, and\\r\\noften the youthful Ruler of Oz was lonely for lack of companionship.\\nIt was the third morning after Dorothy\\'s arrival, and she was sitting\\r\\nwith Ozma and their friends in a reception room, talking over old times,\\r\\nwhen the Princess said to her maid:\\n\"Please go to my boudoir, Jellia, and get the white piglet I left on the\\r\\ndressing-table. I want to play with it.\"[Pg 232]\\nJellia at once departed on the errand, and she was gone so long that\\r\\nthey had almost forgotten her mission when the green robed maiden\\r\\nreturned with a troubled face.\\n\"The piglet is not there, your Highness,\" said she.\\n\"Not there!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"Are you sure?\"\\n\"I have hunted in every part of the room,\" the maid replied.\\n\"Was not the door closed?\" asked the Princess.\\n\"Yes, your Highness; I am sure it was; for when I opened it Dorothy\\'s\\r\\nwhite kitten crept out and ran up the stairs.\"\\nHearing this, Dorothy and the Wizard exchanged startled glances, for\\r\\nthey remembered how often Eureka had longed to eat a piglet. The little\\r\\ngirl jumped up at once.\\n\"Come, Ozma,\" she said, anxiously; \"let us go ourselves to search for\\r\\nthe piglet.\"\\nSo the two went to the dressing-room of the Princess and searched\\r\\ncarefully in every corner and among the vases and baskets and ornaments\\r\\nthat stood about the pretty boudoir. But not a trace could they find of\\r\\nthe tiny creature they sought.\\nDorothy was nearly weeping, by this time, while Ozma was angry and\\r\\nindignant. When they returned to the others the Princess said:\\n\"There is little doubt that my pretty piglet has been[Pg 233] eaten by that\\r\\nhorrid kitten, and if that is true the offender must be punished.\"\\n\"I don\\'t b\\'lieve Eureka would do such a dreadful thing!\" cried Dorothy,\\r\\nmuch distressed. \"Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we\\'ll hear\\r\\nwhat she has to say about it.\"\\nThe green maiden hastened away, but presently returned and said:\\n\"The kitten will not come. She threatened to scratch my eyes out if I\\r\\ntouched her.\"\\n\"Where is she?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Under the bed in your own room,\" was the reply.\\nSo Dorothy ran to her room and found the kitten under the bed.\\n\"Come here, Eureka!\" she said.\\n\"I won\\'t,\" answered the kitten, in a surly voice.\\n\"Oh, Eureka! Why are you so bad?\"\\nThe kitten did not reply.\\n\"If you don\\'t come to me, right away,\" continued Dorothy, getting\\r\\nprovoked, \"I\\'ll take my Magic Belt and wish you in the Country of the\\r\\nGurgles.\"\\n\"Why do you want me?\" asked Eureka, disturbed by this threat.\\n\"You must go to Princess Ozma. She wants to talk to you.\"[Pg 234]\\n\"All right,\" returned the kitten, creeping out. \"I\\'m not afraid of\\r\\nOzma—or anyone else.\"\\nDorothy carried her in her arms back to where the others sat in grieved\\r\\nand thoughtful silence.\\n\"Tell me, Eureka,\" said the Princess, gently: \"did you eat my pretty\\r\\npiglet?\"\\n\"I won\\'t answer such a foolish question,\" asserted Eureka, with a snarl.\\n\"Oh, yes you will, dear,\" Dorothy declared. \"The piglet is gone, and you\\r\\nran out of the room when Jellia opened the door. So, if you are\\r\\ninnocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came to be in her\\r\\nroom, and what has become of the piglet.\"\\n\"Who accuses me?\" asked the kitten, defiantly.\\n\"No one,\" answered Ozma. \"Your actions alone accuse you. The fact is\\r\\nthat I left my little pet in my dressing-room lying asleep upon the\\r\\ntable; and you must hove stolen in without my knowing it. When next the\\r\\ndoor was opened you ran out and hid yourself—and the piglet was gone.\"\\n\"That\\'s none of my business,\" growled the kitten.\\n\"Don\\'t be impudent, Eureka,\" admonished Dorothy.\\n\"It is you who are impudent,\" said Eureka, \"for accusing me of such a\\r\\ncrime when you can\\'t prove it except by guessing.\"[Pg 235]\\nOzma was now greatly incensed by the kitten\\'s conduct. She summoned her\\r\\nCaptain-General, and when the long, lean officer appeared she said:\\n\"Carry this cat away to prison, and keep her in safe confinement until\\r\\nshe is tried by law for the crime of murder.\"\\nSo the Captain-General took Eureka from the arms of the now weeping\\r\\nDorothy and in spite of the kitten\\'s snarls and scratches carried it\\r\\naway to prison.\\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, for such a\\r\\ncrime had cast a gloom over all the company.\\n\"I will summon the Court to meet in the Throne Room at three o\\'clock,\"\\r\\nreplied Ozma. \"I myself will be the judge, and the kitten shall have a\\r\\nfair trial.\"\\n\"What will happen if she is guilty?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"She must die,\" answered the Princess.\\n\"Nine times?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\\n\"As many times as is necessary,\" was the reply. \"I will ask the Tin\\r\\nWoodman to defend the prisoner, because he has such a kind heart I am\\r\\nsure he will do his best to save her. And the Woggle-Bug shall be the\\r\\nPublic Accuser, because he is so learned that no one can deceive him.\"\\n\"Who will be the jury?\" asked the Tin Woodman.[Pg 236]\\n\\n\\nView larger image\\nPORTRAIT OF THE WIZARD OF OZ.\\n\\n\"There ought to be several animals on the jury,\" said Ozma, \"because\\r\\nanimals understand each other better than[Pg 237] we people understand them.\\r\\nSo the jury shall consist of the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, Jim\\r\\nthe Cab-horse, the Yellow Hen, the Scarecrow, the Wizard, Tik-tok the\\r\\nMachine Man, the Sawhorse and Zeb of Hugson\\'s Ranch. That makes the nine\\r\\nwhich the law requires, and all my people shall be admitted to hear the\\r\\ntestimony.\"\\nThey now separated to prepare for the sad ceremony; for whenever an\\r\\nappeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to follow—even in a\\r\\nfairyland like Oz. But it must be stated that the people of that Land\\r\\nwere generally so well-behaved that there was not a single lawyer\\r\\namongst them, and it had been years since any Ruler had sat in judgment\\r\\nupon an offender of the law. The crime of murder being the most dreadful\\r\\ncrime of all, tremendous excitement prevailed in the Emerald City when\\r\\nthe news of Eureka\\'s arrest and trial became known.\\nThe Wizard, when he returned to his own room, was exceedingly\\r\\nthoughtful. He had no doubt Eureka had eaten his piglet, but he realized\\r\\nthat a kitten cannot be depended upon at all times to act properly,\\r\\nsince its nature is to destroy small animals and even birds for food,\\r\\nand the tame cat that we keep in our houses today is descended from the\\r\\nwild cat of the jungle—a very ferocious creature, indeed. The Wizard\\r\\nknew that if Dorothy\\'s pet was found guilty and con[Pg 238]demned to death the\\r\\nlittle girl would be made very unhappy; so, although he grieved over the\\r\\npiglet\\'s sad fate as much as any of them, he resolved to save Eureka\\'s\\r\\nlife.\\nSending for the Tin Woodman the Wizard took him into a corner and\\r\\nwhispered:\\n\"My friend, it is your duty to defend the white kitten and try to save\\r\\nher, but I fear you will fail because Eureka has long wished to eat a\\r\\npiglet, to my certain knowledge, and my opinion is that she has been\\r\\nunable to resist the temptation. Yet her disgrace and death would not\\r\\nbring back the piglet, but only serve to make Dorothy unhappy. So I\\r\\nintend to prove the kitten\\'s innocence by a trick.\"\\nHe drew from his inside pocket one of the eight tiny piglets that were\\r\\nremaining and continued:\\n\"This creature you must hide in some safe place, and if the jury decides\\r\\nthat Eureka is guilty you may then produce this piglet and claim it is\\r\\nthe one that was lost. All the piglets are exactly alike, so no one can\\r\\ndispute your word. This deception will save Eureka\\'s life, and then we\\r\\nmay all be happy again.\"\\n\"I do not like to deceive my friends,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"still,\\r\\nmy kind heart urges me to save Eureka\\'s life, and I can usually trust my\\r\\nheart to do the right thing. So I will do as you say, friend Wizard.\"[Pg 239]\\nAfter some thought he placed the little pig inside his funnel-shaped\\r\\nhat, and then put the hat upon his head and went back to his room to\\r\\nthink over his speech to the jury.[Pg 240]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTER 19.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsTHE WIZARD PERFORMS ANOTHER TRICK\\n\\nT three o\\'clock the Throne Room was crowded with citizens, men, women\\r\\nand children being eager to witness the great trial.\\nPrincess Ozma, dressed in her most splendid robes of state, sat in the\\r\\nmagnificent emerald throne, with her jewelled sceptre in her hand and\\r\\nher sparkling coronet upon her fair brow. Behind her throne stood the\\r\\ntwenty-eight officers of her army and many officials of the royal\\r\\nhousehold. At her right sat the queerly assorted Jury—animals, animated\\r\\ndummies and people—all gravely prepared to listen to what was said. The\\r\\nkitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne, where she\\r\\nsat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds around\\r\\nher, with seeming unconcern.[Pg 241]\\nAnd now, at a signal from Ozma, the Woggle-Bug arose and addressed the\\r\\njury. His tone was pompous and he strutted up and down in an absurd\\r\\nattempt to appear dignified.\\n\"Your Royal Highness and Fellow Citizens,\" he began; \"the small cat you\\r\\nsee a prisoner before you is accused of the crime of first murdering and\\r\\nthen eating our esteemed Ruler\\'s fat piglet—or else first eating and\\r\\nthen murdering it. In either case a grave crime has been committed which\\r\\ndeserves a grave punishment.\"\\n\"Do you mean my kitten must be put in a grave?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Don\\'t interrupt, little girl,\" said the Woggle-Bug. \"When I get my\\r\\nthoughts arranged in good order I do not like to have anything upset\\r\\nthem or throw them into confusion.\"\\n\"If your thoughts were any good they wouldn\\'t become confused,\" remarked\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, earnestly. \"My thoughts are always——\"\\n\"Is this a trial of thoughts, or of kittens?\" demanded the Woggle-Bug.\\n\"It\\'s a trial of one kitten,\" replied the Scarecrow; \"but your manner is\\r\\na trial to us all.\"\\n\"Let the Public Accuser continue,\" called Ozma from her throne, \"and I\\r\\npray you do not interrupt him.\"[Pg 242]\\n\"The criminal who now sits before the court licking her paws,\" resumed\\r\\nthe Woggle-Bug, \"has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet,\\r\\nwhich was no bigger than a mouse. And finally she made a wicked plan to\\r\\nsatisfy her depraved appetite for pork. I can see her, in my mind\\'s\\r\\neye——\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"I say I can see her in my mind\\'s eye——\"\\n\"The mind has no eye,\" declared the Scarecrow. \"It\\'s blind.\"\\n\"Your Highness,\" cried the Woggle-Bug, appealing to Ozma, \"have I a\\r\\nmind\\'s eye, or haven\\'t I?\"\\n\"If you have, it is invisible,\" said the Princess.\\n\"Very true,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, bowing. \"I say I see the criminal,\\r\\nin my mind\\'s eye, creeping stealthily into the room of our Ozma and\\r\\nsecreting herself, when no one was looking, until the Princess had gone\\r\\naway and the door was closed. Then the murderer was alone with her\\r\\nhelpless victim, the fat piglet, and I see her pounce upon the innocent\\r\\ncreature and eat it up——\"\\n\"Are you still seeing with your mind\\'s eye?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\\n\"Of course; how else could I see it? And we know the thing is true,\\r\\nbecause since the time of that interview there is no piglet to be found\\r\\nanywhere.\"[Pg 243]\\n\\n\\nEUREKA IN COURT.\\n\\n[Pg 244][Pg 245]\\n\"I suppose, if the cat had been gone, instead of the piglet, your mind\\'s\\r\\neye would see the piglet eating the cat,\" suggested the Scarecrow.\\n\"Very likely,\" acknowledged the Woggle-Bug. \"And now, Fellow Citizens\\r\\nand Creatures of the Jury, I assert that so awful a crime deserves\\r\\ndeath, and in the case of the ferocious criminal before you—who is now\\r\\nwashing her face—the death penalty should be inflicted nine times.\"\\nThere was great applause when the speaker sat down. Then the Princess\\r\\nspoke in a stern voice:\\n\"Prisoner, what have you to say for yourself? Are you guilty, or not\\r\\nguilty?\"\\n\"Why, that\\'s for you to find out,\" replied Eureka. \"If you can prove I\\'m\\r\\nguilty, I\\'ll be willing to die nine times, but a mind\\'s eye is no proof,\\r\\nbecause the Woggle-Bug has no mind to see with.\"\\n\"Never mind, dear,\" said Dorothy.\\nThen the Tin Woodman arose and said:\\n\"Respected Jury and dearly beloved Ozma, I pray you not to judge this\\r\\nfeline prisoner unfeelingly. I do not think the innocent kitten can be\\r\\nguilty, and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder.\\r\\nEureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire, and\\r\\ngentleness and innocence are her chief virtues. Look at the kitten\\'s\\r\\nintelli[Pg 246]gent eyes;\" (here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily) \"gaze at her\\r\\nsmiling countenance!\" (here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth) \"mark\\r\\nthe tender pose of her soft, padded little hands!\" (Here Eureka bared\\r\\nher sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage.) \"Would such a\\r\\ngentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature? No; a thousand\\r\\ntimes, no!\"\\n\"Oh, cut it short,\" said Eureka; \"you\\'ve talked long enough.\"\\n\"I\\'m trying to defend you,\" remonstrated the Tin Woodman.\\n\"Then say something sensible,\" retorted the kitten. \"Tell them it would\\r\\nbe foolish for me to eat the piglet, because I had sense enough to know\\r\\nit would raise a row if I did. But don\\'t try to make out I\\'m too\\r\\ninnocent to eat a fat piglet if I could do it and not be found out. I\\r\\nimagine it would taste mighty good.\"\\n\"Perhaps it would, to those who eat,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"I\\r\\nmyself, not being built to eat, have no personal experience in such\\r\\nmatters. But I remember that our great poet once said:\\n\\n\"\\'To eat is sweet\\nWhen hunger\\'s seat\\nDemands a treat\\nOf savory meat.\\'\\n[Pg 247]\\n\"Take this into consideration, friends of the Jury, and you will readily\\r\\ndecide that the kitten is wrongfully accused and should be set at\\r\\nliberty.\"\\nWhen the Tin Woodman sat down no one applauded him, for his arguments\\r\\nhad not been very convincing and few believed that he had proved\\r\\nEureka\\'s innocence. As for the Jury, the members whispered to each other\\r\\nfor a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger their\\r\\nspokesman. The huge beast slowly arose and said:\\n\"Kittens have no consciences, so they eat whatever pleases them. The\\r\\njury believes the white kitten known as Eureka is guilty of having eaten\\r\\nthe piglet owned by Princess Ozma, and recommends that she be put to\\r\\ndeath in punishment of the crime.\"\\nThe judgment of the jury was received with great applause, although\\r\\nDorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet. The Princess was\\r\\njust about to order Eureka\\'s head chopped off with the Tin Woodman\\'s axe\\r\\nwhen that brilliant personage once more arose and addressed her.\\n\"Your Highness,\" said he, \"see how easy it is for a jury to be mistaken.\\r\\nThe kitten could not have eaten your piglet—for here it is!\"\\nHe took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny white\\r\\npiglet, which he held aloft that all might see it clearly.[Pg 248]\\nOzma was delighted and exclaimed, eagerly:\\n\"Give me my pet, Nick Chopper!\"\\nAnd all the people cheered and clapped their hands, rejoicing that the\\r\\nprisoner had escaped death and been proved to be innocent.\\nAs the Princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its soft\\r\\nhair she said: \"Let Eureka out of the cage, for she is no longer a\\r\\nprisoner, but our good friend. Where did you find my missing pet, Nick\\r\\nChopper?\"\\n\"In a room of the palace,\" he answered.\\n\"Justice,\" remarked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, \"is a dangerous thing to\\r\\nmeddle with. If you hadn\\'t happened to find the piglet, Eureka would\\r\\nsurely have been executed.\"\\n\"But justice prevailed at the last,\" said Ozma, \"for here is my pet, and\\r\\nEureka is once more free.\"\\n\"I refuse to be free,\" cried the kitten, in a sharp voice, \"unless the\\r\\nWizard can do his trick with eight piglets. If he can produce but seven,\\r\\nthen this it not the piglet that was lost, but another one.\"\\n\"Hush, Eureka!\" warned the Wizard.\\n\"Don\\'t be foolish,\" advised the Tin Woodman, \"or you may be sorry for\\r\\nit.\"\\n\"The piglet that belonged to the Princess wore an emerald collar,\" said\\r\\nEureka, loudly enough for all to hear.[Pg 249]\\n\"So it did!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"This cannot be the one the Wizard gave\\r\\nme.\"\\n\"Of course not; he had nine of them, altogether,\" declared Eureka; \"and\\r\\nI must say it was very stingy of him not to let me eat just a few. But\\r\\nnow that this foolish trial is ended, I will tell you what really became\\r\\nof your pet piglet.\"\\nAt this everyone in the Throne Room suddenly became quiet, and the\\r\\nkitten continued, in a calm, mocking tone of voice:\\n\"I will confess that I intended to eat the little pig for my breakfast;\\r\\nso I crept into the room where it was kept while the Princess was\\r\\ndressing and hid myself under a chair. When Ozma went away she closed\\r\\nthe door and left her pet on the table. At once I jumped up and told the\\r\\npiglet not to make a fuss, for he would be inside of me in half a\\r\\nsecond; but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable.\\r\\nInstead of keeping still, so I could eat him comfortably, he trembled so\\r\\nwith fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standing\\r\\non the floor. The vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the top\\r\\nlike a bowl. At first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and I\\r\\nthought I should get him, after all, but he wriggled himself through and\\r\\nfell down into the deep bottom part—and I suppose he\\'s there yet.\"[Pg 250]\\nAll were astonished at this confession, and Ozma at once sent an officer\\r\\nto her room to fetch the vase. When he returned the Princess looked down\\r\\nthe narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet, just\\r\\nas Eureka had said she would.\\nThere was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, so\\r\\nthe Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner\\r\\nfree.\\nThen the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her arms\\r\\nand told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent.\\n\"But why didn\\'t you tell us at first?\" she asked.\\n\"It would have spoiled the fun,\" replied the kitten, yawning.\\nOzma gave the Wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed Nick\\r\\nChopper to substitute for the lost one, and then she carried her own\\r\\ninto the apartments of the palace where she lived. And now, the trial\\r\\nbeing over, the good citizens of the Emerald City scattered to their\\r\\nhomes, well content with the day\\'s amusement.[Pg 251]\\n\\nCHAPTER 20.\\n\\n\\n\\nContentsZEB RETURNS TO THE RANCH\\n\\nUREKA was much surprised to find herself in disgrace; but she was, in\\r\\nspite of the fact that she had not eaten the piglet. For the folks of Oz\\r\\nknew the kitten had tried to commit the crime, and that only an accident\\r\\nhad prevented her from doing so; therefore even the Hungry Tiger\\r\\npreferred not to associate with her. Eureka was forbidden to wander\\r\\naround the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothy\\'s room;\\r\\nso she began to beg her mistress to send her to some other place where\\r\\nshe could enjoy herself better.\\nDorothy was herself anxious to get home, so she promised Eureka they\\r\\nwould not stay in the Land of Oz much longer.[Pg 252]\\nThe next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allow\\r\\nher to look in the enchanted picture, and the Princess readily\\r\\nconsented. She took the child to her room and said: \"Make your wish,\\r\\ndear, and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold.\"\\nThen Dorothy found, with the aid of the enchanted picture, that Uncle\\r\\nHenry had returned to the farm in Kansas, and she also saw that both he\\r\\nand Aunt Em were dressed in mourning, because they thought their little\\r\\nniece had been killed by the earthquake.\\n\"Really,\" said the girl, anxiously, \"I must get back as soon as poss\\'ble\\r\\nto my own folks.\"\\nZeb also wanted to see his home, and although he did not find anyone\\r\\nmourning for him, the sight of Hugson\\'s Ranch in the picture made him\\r\\nlong to get back there.\\n\"This is a fine country, and I like all the people that live in it,\" he\\r\\ntold Dorothy. \"But the fact is, Jim and I don\\'t seem to fit into a\\r\\nfairyland, and the old horse has been begging me to go home again ever\\r\\nsince he lost the race. So, if you can find a way to fix it, we\\'ll be\\r\\nmuch obliged to you.\"\\n\"Ozma can do it, easily,\" replied Dorothy. \"Tomorrow morning I\\'ll go to\\r\\nKansas and you can go to Californy.\"\\n[Pg 253]\\n\\n\\n\"I\\'M MUCH OBLIGED FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS.\"\\n\\nThat last evening was so delightful that the boy will never forget it as\\r\\nlong as he lives. They were all together[Pg 254] (except Eureka) in the\\r\\npretty rooms of the Princess, and the Wizard did some new tricks, and\\r\\nthe Scarecrow told stories, and the Tin Woodman sang a love song in a\\r\\nsonorous, metallic voice, and everybody laughed and had a good time.\\r\\nThen Dorothy wound up Tik-tok and he danced a jig to amuse the company,\\r\\nafter which the Yellow Hen related some of her adventures with the Nome\\r\\nKing in the Land of Ev.\\n[Pg 255]\\nThe Princess served delicious refreshments to those who were in the\\r\\nhabit of eating, and when Dorothy\\'s bed time arrived the company\\r\\nseparated after exchanging many friendly sentiments.\\nNext morning they all assembled for the final parting, and many of the\\r\\nofficials and courtiers came to look upon the impressive ceremonies.\\nDorothy held Eureka in her arms and bade her friends a fond good-bye.\\n\"You must come again, some time,\" said the little Wizard; and she\\r\\npromised she would if she found it possible to do so.\\n\"But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em need me to help them,\" she added, \"so I\\r\\ncan\\'t ever be very long away from the farm in Kansas.\"\\nOzma wore the Magic Belt; and, when she had kissed[Pg 256] Dorothy farewell and\\r\\nhad made her wish, the little girl and her kitten disappeared in a\\r\\ntwinkling.\\n\"Where is she?\" asked Zeb, rather bewildered by the suddenness of it.\\n\"Greeting her uncle and aunt in Kansas, by this time,\" returned Ozma,\\r\\nwith a smile.\\nThen Zeb brought out Jim, all harnessed to the buggy, and took his seat.\\n\"I\\'m much obliged for all your kindness,\" said the boy, \"and very\\r\\ngrateful to you for saving my life and sending me home again after all\\r\\nthe good times I\\'ve had. I think this is the loveliest country in the\\r\\nworld; but not being fairies Jim and I feel we ought to be where we\\r\\nbelong—and that\\'s at the ranch. Good-bye, everybody!\"\\nHe gave a start and rubbed his eyes. Jim was trotting along the\\r\\nwell-known road, shaking his ears and whisking his tail with a contented\\r\\nmotion. Just ahead of them were the gates of Hugson\\'s Ranch, and Uncle\\r\\nHugson now came out and stood with uplifted arms and wide open mouth,\\r\\nstaring in amazement.\\n\"Goodness gracious! It\\'s Zeb—and Jim, too!\" he exclaimed. \"Where in the\\r\\nworld have you been, my lad?\"\\n\"Why, in the world, Uncle,\" answered Zeb, with a laugh.[Pg 257]\\n\\n\\n\\n[Pg 258]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\\'s Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, by L.

To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.

NEILL\\nCHICAGO\\nTHE REILLY & BRITTON CO.\\nPUBLISHERS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\no my readers: Well, my dears, here is what you have asked for: another\\r\\n\"Oz Book\" about Dorothy\\'s strange adventures. Toto is in this story,\\r\\nbecause you wanted him to be there, and many other characters which you\\r\\nwill recognize are in the story, too. Indeed, the wishes of my little\\r\\ncorrespondents have been considered as carefully as possible, and if the\\r\\nstory is not exactly as you would have written it yourselves, you must\\r\\nremember that a story has to be a story before it can be written down,\\r\\nand the writer cannot change it much without spoiling it.\\nIn the preface to \"Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz\" I said I would like to\\r\\nwrite some stories that were not \"Oz\" stories, because I thought I had\\r\\nwritten about Oz long enough; but since that volume was published I have\\r\\nbeen fairly deluged with letters from children imploring me to \"write\\r\\nmore about Dorothy,\" and \"more about Oz,\" and since I write only to\\r\\nplease the children I shall try to respect their wishes.\\nThere are some new characters in this book that ought to win your love.\\r\\nI\\'m very fond of the shaggy man myself, and I think you will like him,\\r\\ntoo. As for Polychrome—the Rainbow\\'s Daughter—and stupid little\\r\\nButton-Bright, they seem to have brought a new element of fun into these\\r\\nOz stories, and I am glad I discovered them. Yet I am anxious to have\\r\\nyou write and tell me how you like them.\\nSince this book was written I have received some very remarkable news\\r\\nfrom The Land of Oz, which has greatly astonished me. I believe it will\\r\\nastonish you, too, my dears, when you hear it. But it is such a long and\\r\\nexciting story that it must be saved for another book—and perhaps that\\r\\nbook will be the last story that will ever be told about the Land of Oz.\\nL Frank Baum.\\nCoronado, 1909.\\n\\n\\n\\nLIST OF CHAPTERS\\n\\n1.The Way to Butterfield\\n2.Dorothy Meets Button-bright\\n3.A Queer Village\\n4.King Dox\\n5.The Rainbow\\'s Daughter\\n6.The City of Beasts\\n7.The Shaggy Man\\'s Transformation\\n8.The Musicker\\n9.Facing the Scoodlers\\n10.Escaping the Soup-kettle\\n11.Johnny Dooit Does It\\n12.The Deadly Desert Crossed\\n13.The Truth Pond\\n14.Tik-Tok and Billina\\n15.The Emperor\\'s Tin Castle\\n16.Visiting the Pumpkin-Field\\n17.The Royal Chariot Arrives\\n18.The Emerald City\\n19.The Shaggy Man\\'s Welcome\\n20.Princess Ozma of Oz\\n21.Dorothy Receives the Guests\\n22.Important Arrivals\\n23.The Grand Banquet\\n24.The Birthday Celebration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"PLEASE, miss,\" said the shaggy man, \"can you tell me the road to\\r\\nButterfield?\"\\nDorothy looked him over. Yes, he was shaggy, all right; but there was a\\r\\ntwinkle in his eye that seemed pleasant.\\n\"Oh, yes,\" she replied; \"I can tell you. But it isn\\'t this road at all.\"\\n\"No?\"\\n\"You cross the ten-acre lot, follow the lane to the highway, go north to\\r\\nthe five branches, and take—let me see—\"\\n\"To be sure, miss; see as far as Butterfield, if you like,\" said the\\r\\nshaggy man.\\n\"You take the branch next the willow stump, I b\\'lieve; or else the\\r\\nbranch by the gopher holes; or else——\"\\n\"Won\\'t any of \\'em do, miss?\"\\n\"\\'Course not, Shaggy Man. You must take the right road to get to\\r\\nButterfield.\"\\n\"And is that the one by the gopher stump, or——\"\\n\"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy; \"I shall have to show you the way; you\\'re so\\r\\nstupid. Wait a minute till I run in the house and get my sunbonnet.\"\\nThe shaggy man waited. He had an oat-straw in his mouth, which he chewed\\r\\nslowly as if it tasted good; but it didn\\'t. There was an apple-tree\\r\\nbeside the house, and some apples had fallen to the ground. The shaggy\\r\\nman thought they would taste better than the oat-straw, so he walked\\r\\nover to get some. A little black dog with bright brown eyes dashed out\\r\\nof the farm-house and ran madly toward the shaggy man, who had already\\r\\npicked up three apples and put them in one of the big wide pockets of\\r\\nhis shaggy coat. The little dog barked, and made a dive for the shaggy\\r\\nman\\'s leg; but he grabbed the dog by the neck and put it in his big\\r\\npocket along with the apples. He took more apples, afterward, for many\\r\\nwere on the ground; and each one that he tossed into his pocket hit the\\r\\nlittle dog somewhere upon the head or back, and made him growl. The\\r\\nlittle dog\\'s name was Toto, and he was sorry he had been put in the\\r\\nshaggy man\\'s pocket.\\n\\nPretty soon Dorothy came out of the house with her sunbonnet, and she\\r\\ncalled out:\\n\"Come on, Shaggy Man, if you want me to show you the road to\\r\\nButterfield.\" She climbed the fence into the ten-acre lot and he\\r\\nfollowed her, walking slowly and stumbling over the little hillocks in\\r\\nthe pasture as if he was thinking of something else and did not notice\\r\\nthem.\\n\"My, but you\\'re clumsy!\" said the little girl. \"Are your feet tired?\"\\n\"No, miss; it\\'s my whiskers; they tire very easily this warm weather,\"\\r\\nsaid he. \"I wish it would snow; don\\'t you?\"\\n\"\\'Course not, Shaggy Man,\" replied Dorothy, giving him a severe look.\\r\\n\"If it snowed in August it would spoil the corn and the oats and the\\r\\nwheat; and then Uncle Henry wouldn\\'t have any crops; and that would make\\r\\nhim poor; and——\"\\n\"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man. \"It won\\'t snow, I guess. Is this the\\r\\nlane?\"\\n\"Yes,\" replied Dorothy, climbing another fence; \"I\\'ll go as far as the\\r\\nhighway with you.\"\\n\"Thankee, miss; you\\'re very kind for your size, I\\'m sure,\" said he\\r\\ngratefully.\\n\"It isn\\'t everyone who knows the road to Butterfield,\" Dorothy remarked\\r\\nas she tripped along the lane; \"but I\\'ve driven there many a time with\\r\\nUncle Henry, and so I b\\'lieve I could find it blindfolded.\"\\n\"Don\\'t do that, miss,\" said the shaggy man, earnestly; \"you might make a\\r\\nmistake.\"\\n\"I won\\'t,\" she answered, laughing. \"Here\\'s the highway. Now, it\\'s the\\r\\nsecond—no, the third turn to the left—or else it\\'s the fourth. Let\\'s\\r\\nsee. The first one is by the elm tree; and the second is by the gopher\\r\\nholes; and then——\"\\n\"Then what?\" he inquired, putting his hands in his coat pockets. Toto\\r\\ngrabbed a finger and bit it; the shaggy man took his hand out of that\\r\\npocket quickly, and said \"Oh!\"\\nDorothy did not notice. She was shading her eyes from the sun with her\\r\\narm, looking anxiously down the road.\\n\"Come on,\" she commanded. \"It\\'s only a little way farther, so I may as\\r\\nwell show you.\"\\nAfter a while they came to the place where five roads branched in\\r\\ndifferent directions; Dorothy pointed to one, and said:\\n\"That\\'s it, Shaggy Man.\"\\n\"I\\'m much obliged, miss,\" he said, and started along another road.\\n\"Not that one!\" she cried; \"you\\'re going wrong.\"\\nHe stopped.\\n\"I thought you said that other was the road to Butterfield,\" said he,\\r\\nrunning his fingers through his shaggy whiskers in a puzzled way.\\n\"So it is.\"\\n\"But I don\\'t want to go to Butterfield, miss.\"\\n\"You don\\'t?\"\\n\"Of course not. I wanted you to show me the road, so I shouldn\\'t go\\r\\nthere by mistake.\"\\n\"Oh! Where do you want to go to, then?\"\\n\"I\\'m not particular, miss.\"\\nThis answer astonished the little girl; and it made her provoked, too,\\r\\nto think she had taken all this trouble for nothing.\\n\"There are a good many roads here,\" observed the shaggy man, turning\\r\\nslowly around, like a human windmill.\\n\"Seems to me a person could go \\'most anywhere, from this place.\"\\nDorothy turned around too, and gazed in surprise. There were a good\\r\\nmany roads; more than she had ever seen before. She tried to count them,\\r\\nknowing there ought to be five; but when she had counted seventeen she\\r\\ngrew bewildered and stopped, for the roads were as many as the spokes of\\r\\na wheel and ran in every direction from the place where they stood; so\\r\\nif she kept on counting she was likely to count some of the roads twice.\\n\"Dear me!\" she exclaimed. \"There used to be only five roads, highway and\\r\\nall. And now—why, where\\'s the highway, Shaggy Man?\"\\n\"Can\\'t say, miss,\" he responded, sitting down upon the ground as if\\r\\ntired with standing. \"Wasn\\'t it here a minute ago?\"\\n\"I thought so,\" she answered, greatly perplexed. \"And I saw the gopher\\r\\nholes, too, and the dead stump; but they\\'re not here now. These roads\\r\\nare all strange—and what a lot of them there are! Where do you suppose\\r\\nthey all go to?\"\\n\"Roads,\" observed the shaggy man, \"don\\'t go anywhere. They stay in one\\r\\nplace, so folks can walk on them.\"\\nHe put his hand in his side-pocket and drew out an apple—quick, before\\r\\nToto could bite him again. The little dog got his head out this time\\r\\nand said \"Bow-wow!\" so loudly that it made Dorothy jump.\\n\"O Toto!\" she cried; \"where did you come from?\"\\n\"I brought him along,\" said the shaggy man.\\n\"What for?\" she asked.\\n\"To guard these apples in my pocket, miss, so no one would steal them.\"\\nWith one hand the shaggy man held the apple, which he began eating,\\r\\nwhile with the other hand he pulled Toto out of his pocket and dropped\\r\\nhim to the ground. Of course Toto made for Dorothy at once, barking\\r\\njoyfully at his release from the dark pocket. When the child had patted\\r\\nhis head lovingly, he sat down before her, his red tongue hanging out\\r\\none side of his mouth, and looked up into her face with his bright brown\\r\\neyes, as if asking her what they should do next.\\nDorothy didn\\'t know. She looked around her anxiously for some familiar\\r\\nlandmark; but everything was strange. Between the branches of the many\\r\\nroads were green meadows and a few shrubs and trees, but she couldn\\'t\\r\\nsee anywhere the farm-house from which she had just come, or anything\\r\\nshe had ever seen before—except the shaggy man and Toto.\\nBesides this, she had turned around and around so many times, trying to\\r\\nfind out where she was, that now she couldn\\'t even tell which direction\\r\\nthe farm-house ought to be in; and this began to worry her and make her\\r\\nfeel anxious.\\n\"I\\'m \\'fraid, Shaggy Man,\" she said, with a sigh, \"that we\\'re lost!\"\\n\"That\\'s nothing to be afraid of,\" he replied, throwing away the core of\\r\\nhis apple and beginning to eat another one. \"Each of these roads must\\r\\nlead somewhere, or it wouldn\\'t be here. So what does it matter?\"\\n\"I want to go home again,\" she said.\\n\"Well, why don\\'t you?\" said he.\\n\"I don\\'t know which road to take.\"\\n\"That is too bad,\" he said, shaking his shaggy head gravely. \"I wish I\\r\\ncould help you; but I can\\'t. I\\'m a stranger in these parts.\"\\n\"Seems as if I were, too,\" she said, sitting down beside him. \"It\\'s\\r\\nfunny. A few minutes ago I was home, and I just came to show you the way\\r\\nto Butterfield——\"\\n\"So I shouldn\\'t make a mistake and go there——\"\\n\"And now I\\'m lost myself and don\\'t now how to get home!\"\\n\"Have an apple,\" suggested the shaggy man, handing her one with pretty\\r\\nred cheeks.\\n\"I\\'m not hungry,\" said Dorothy, pushing it away.\\n\"But you may be, to-morrow; then you\\'ll be sorry you didn\\'t eat the\\r\\napple,\" said he.\\n\"If I am, I\\'ll eat the apple then,\" promised Dorothy.\\n\"Perhaps there won\\'t be any apple then,\" he returned, beginning to eat\\r\\nthe red-cheeked one himself. \"Dogs sometimes can find their way home\\r\\nbetter than people,\" he went on; \"perhaps your dog can lead you back to\\r\\nthe farm.\"\\n\"Will you, Toto?\" asked Dorothy.\\nToto wagged his tail vigorously.\\n\"All right,\" said the girl; \"let\\'s go home.\"\\nToto looked around a minute, and dashed up one of the roads.\\n\"Good-bye, Shaggy Man,\" called Dorothy, and ran after Toto. The little\\r\\ndog pranced briskly along for some distance; when he turned around and\\r\\nlooked at his mistress questioningly.\\n\"Oh, don\\'t \\'spect me to tell you anything; I don\\'t know the way,\" she\\r\\nsaid. \"You\\'ll have to find it yourself.\"\\nBut Toto couldn\\'t. He wagged his tail, and sneezed, and shook his ears,\\r\\nand trotted back where they had left the shaggy man. From here he\\r\\nstarted along another road; then came back and tried another; but each\\r\\ntime he found the way strange and decided it would not take them to the\\r\\nfarm house. Finally, when Dorothy had begun to tire with chasing after\\r\\nhim, Toto sat down panting beside the shaggy man and gave up.\\nDorothy sat down, too, very thoughtful. The little girl had encountered\\r\\nsome queer adventures since she came to live at the farm; but this was\\r\\nthe queerest of them all. To get lost in fifteen minutes, so near to\\r\\nher home and in the unromantic State of Kansas, was an experience that\\r\\nfairly bewildered her.\\n\"Will your folks worry?\" asked the shaggy man, his eyes twinkling in a\\r\\npleasant way.\\n\"I s\\'pose so,\" answered Dorothy, with a sigh. \"Uncle Henry says there\\'s\\r\\nalways something happening to me; but I\\'ve always come home safe at\\r\\nthe last. So perhaps he\\'ll take comfort and think I\\'ll come home safe\\r\\nthis time.\"\\n\"I\\'m sure you will,\" said the shaggy man, smilingly nodding at her.\\r\\n\"Good little girls never come to any harm, you know. For my part, I\\'m\\r\\ngood, too; so nothing ever hurts me.\"\\nDorothy looked at him curiously. His clothes were shaggy, his boots were\\r\\nshaggy and full of holes, and his hair and whiskers were shaggy. But his\\r\\nsmile was sweet and his eyes were kind.\\n\"Why didn\\'t you want to go to Butterfield?\" she asked.\\n\"Because a man lives there who owes me fifteen cents, and if I went to\\r\\nButterfield and he saw me he\\'d want to pay me the money. I don\\'t want\\r\\nmoney, my dear.\"\\n\"Why not?\" she inquired.\\n\"Money,\" declared the shaggy man, \"makes people proud and haughty; I\\r\\ndon\\'t want to be proud and haughty. All I want is to have people love\\r\\nme; and as long as I own the Love Magnet everyone I meet is sure to love\\r\\nme dearly.\"\\n\"THIS, MY DEAR, IS THE WONDERFUL LOVE MAGNET.\"\\n\"The Love Magnet! Why, what\\'s that?\"\\n\"I\\'ll show you, if you won\\'t tell anyone,\" he answered, in a low,\\r\\nmysterious voice.\\n\"There isn\\'t any one to tell, \\'cept Toto,\" said the girl.\\nThe shaggy man searched in one pocket, carefully; and in another pocket;\\r\\nand in a third. At last he drew out a small parcel wrapped in crumpled\\r\\npaper and tied with a cotton string. He unwound the string, opened the\\r\\nparcel, and took out a bit of metal shaped like a horseshoe. It was dull\\r\\nand brown, and not very pretty.\\n\"This, my dear,\" said he, impressively, \"is the wonderful Love Magnet.\\r\\nIt was given me by an Eskimo in the Sandwich Islands—where there are no\\r\\nsandwiches at all—and as long as I carry it every living thing I meet\\r\\nwill love me dearly.\"\\n\"Why didn\\'t the Eskimo keep it?\" she asked, looking at the Magnet with\\r\\ninterest.\\n\"He got tired being loved and longed for some one to hate him. So he\\r\\ngave me the Magnet and the very next day a grizzly bear ate him.\"\\n\"Wasn\\'t he sorry then?\" she inquired.\\n\"He didn\\'t say,\" replied the shaggy man, wrapping and tying the Love\\r\\nMagnet with great care and putting it away in another pocket. \"But the\\r\\nbear didn\\'t seem sorry a bit,\" he added.\\n\"Did you know the bear?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\\n\"Yes; we used to play ball together in the Caviar Islands. The bear\\r\\nloved me because I had the Love Magnet. I couldn\\'t blame him for eating\\r\\nthe Eskimo, because it was his nature to do so.\"\\n\"Once,\" said Dorothy, \"I knew a Hungry Tiger who longed to eat fat\\r\\nbabies, because it was his nature to; but he never ate any because he\\r\\nhad a Conscience.\"\\n\"This bear,\" replied the shaggy man, with a sigh, \"had no Conscience,\\r\\nyou see.\"\\nThe shaggy man sat silent for several minutes, apparently considering\\r\\nthe cases of the bear and the tiger, while Toto watched him with an air\\r\\nof great interest. The little dog was doubtless thinking of his ride in\\r\\nthe shaggy man\\'s pocket and planning to keep out of reach in the future.\\nAt last the shaggy man turned and inquired, \"What\\'s your name, little\\r\\ngirl?\"\\n\"My name\\'s Dorothy,\" said she, jumping up again, \"but what are we going\\r\\nto do? We can\\'t stay here forever, you know.\"\\n\"Let\\'s take the seventh road,\" he suggested. \"Seven is a lucky number\\r\\nfor little girls named Dorothy.\"\\n\"The seventh from where?\"\\n\"From where you begin to count.\"\\nSo she counted seven roads, and the seventh looked just like all the\\r\\nothers; but the shaggy man got up from the ground where he had been\\r\\nsitting and started down this road as if sure it was the best way to go;\\r\\nand Dorothy and Toto followed him.\\n\\n\\nTHE seventh road was a good road, and curved this way and that—winding\\r\\nthrough green meadows and fields covered with daisies and buttercups and\\r\\npast groups of shady trees. There were no houses of any sort to be seen,\\r\\nand for some distance they met with no living creature at all.\\nDorothy began to fear they were getting a good way from the\\r\\nfarm-house, since here everything was strange to her; but it would do\\r\\nno good at all to go back where the other roads all met, because the\\r\\nnext one they chose might lead her just as far from home.\\nShe kept on beside the shaggy man, who whistled cheerful tunes to\\r\\nbeguile the journey, until by-and-by they followed a turn in the road\\r\\nand saw before them a big chestnut tree making a shady spot over the\\r\\nhighway. In the shade sat a little boy dressed in sailor clothes, who\\r\\nwas digging a hole in the earth with a bit of wood. He must have been\\r\\ndigging some time, because the hole was already big enough to drop a\\r\\nfoot-ball into.\\nDorothy and Toto and the shaggy man came to a halt before the little\\r\\nboy, who kept on digging in a sober and persistent fashion.\\n\"Who are you?\" asked the girl.\\nHe looked up at her calmly. His face was round and chubby and his eyes\\r\\nwere big, blue, and earnest.\\n\"I\\'m Button-Bright,\" said he.\\n\"But what\\'s you real name?\" she inquired.\\n\"Button-Bright.\"\\n\"That isn\\'t a really-truly name!\" she exclaimed.\\n\"Isn\\'t it?\" he asked, still digging.\\n\"\\'Course not. It\\'s just a—a thing to call you by. You must have a\\r\\nname.\"\\n\"Must I?\"\\n\"To be sure. What does your mamma call you?\"\\nHe paused in his digging and tried to think.\\n\"Papa always said I was bright as a button; so mamma always called me\\r\\nButton-Bright,\" he said.\\n\"What is your papa\\'s name?\"\\n\"Just Papa.\"\\n\"What else?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know.\"\\n\"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man, smiling. \"We\\'ll call the boy\\r\\nButton-Bright, as his mamma does. That name is as good as any, and\\r\\nbetter than some.\"\\nDorothy watched the boy dig.\\n\"Where do you live?\" she asked.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" was the reply.\\n\"How did you come here?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" he said again.\\n\"Don\\'t you know where you came from?\"\\n\"No,\" said he.\\n\"Why, he must be lost,\" she said to the shaggy man. She turned to the\\r\\nboy once more.\\n\"What are you going to do?\" she inquired.\\n\"Dig,\" said he.\\n\"But you can\\'t dig forever; and what are you going to do then?\" she\\r\\npersisted.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said the boy.\\n\"But you must know something,\" declared Dorothy, getting provoked.\\n\"Must I?\" he asked, looking up in surprise.\\n\"Of course you must.\"\\n\"What must I know?\"\\n\"What\\'s going to become of you, for one thing,\" she answered.\\n\"Do you know what\\'s going to become of me?\" he asked.\\n\"Not—not \\'zactly,\" she admitted.\\n\"Do you know what\\'s going to become of you?\" he continued, earnestly.\\n\\n\"I can\\'t say I do,\" replied Dorothy, remembering her present\\r\\ndifficulties.\\nThe shaggy man laughed.\\n\"No one knows everything, Dorothy,\" he said.\\n\"But Button-Bright doesn\\'t seem to know anything,\" she declared. \"Do\\r\\nyou, Button-Bright?\"\\nHe shook his head, which had pretty curls all over it, and replied with\\r\\nperfect calmness:\\n\"Don\\'t know.\"\\nNever before had Dorothy met with any one who could give her so little\\r\\ninformation. The boy was evidently lost, and his people would be sure to\\r\\nworry about him. He seemed two or three years younger than Dorothy, and\\r\\nwas prettily dressed, as if some one loved him dearly and took much\\r\\npains to make him look well. How, then, did he come to be in this lonely\\r\\nroad? she wondered.\\nNear Button-Bright, on the ground, lay a sailor hat with a gilt anchor\\r\\non the band. His sailor trousers were long and wide at the bottom, and\\r\\nthe broad collar of his blouse had gold anchors sewed on its corners.\\r\\nThe boy was still digging at his hole.\\n\"Have you ever been to sea?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"To see what?\" answered Button-Bright.\\n\"I mean have you ever been where there\\'s water?\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Button-Bright; \"there\\'s a well in our back yard.\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand,\" cried Dorothy. \"I mean, have you ever been on a\\r\\nbig ship floating on a big ocean?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said he.\\n\"Then why do you wear sailor clothes?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" he answered, again.\\nDorothy was in despair.\\n\"You\\'re just awful stupid, Button-Bright,\" she said.\\n\"Am I?\" he asked.\\n\"Yes, you are.\"\\n\"Why?\" looking up at her with big eyes.\\nShe was going to say: \"Don\\'t know,\" but stopped herself in time.\\n\"That\\'s for you to answer,\" she replied.\\n\"It\\'s no use asking Button-Bright questions,\" said the shaggy man, who\\r\\nhad been eating another apple; \"but some one ought to take care of the\\r\\npoor little chap, don\\'t you think? So he\\'d better come along with us.\"\\nToto had been looking with great curiosity into the hole which the boy\\r\\nwas digging, and growing more and more excited every minute, perhaps\\r\\nthinking that Button-Bright was after some wild animal. The little dog\\r\\nbegan barking loudly and jumped into the hole himself, where he began to\\r\\ndig with his tiny paws, making the earth fly in all directions. It\\r\\nspattered over the boy. Dorothy seized him and raised him to his feet,\\r\\nbrushing his clothes with her hand.\\n\"Stop that, Toto!\" she called. \"There aren\\'t any mice or woodchucks in\\r\\nthat hole, so don\\'t be foolish.\"\\nToto stopped, sniffed at the hole suspiciously, and jumped out of it,\\r\\nwagging his tail as if he had done something important.\\n\"Well,\" said the shaggy man, \"let\\'s start on, or we won\\'t get anywhere\\r\\nbefore night comes.\"\\n\"Where do you expect to get to?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"I\\'m like Button-Bright; I don\\'t know,\" answered the shaggy man, with a\\r\\nlaugh. \"But I\\'ve learned from long experience that every road leads\\r\\nsomewhere, or there wouldn\\'t be any road; so it\\'s likely that if we\\r\\ntravel long enough, my dear, we will come to some place or another in\\r\\nthe end. What place it will be we can\\'t even guess at this moment, but\\r\\nwe\\'re sure to find out when we get there.\"\\n\"Why, yes,\" said Dorothy; \"that seems reas\\'n\\'ble, Shaggy Man.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nBUTTON-BRIGHT took the shaggy man\\'s hand willingly; for the shaggy man\\r\\nhad the Love Magnet, you know, which was the reason Button-Bright had\\r\\nloved him at once. They started on, with Dorothy on one side, and Toto\\r\\non the other, the little party trudging along more cheerfully than you\\r\\nmight have supposed. The girl was getting used to queer adventures,\\r\\nwhich interested her very much. Wherever Dorothy went Toto was sure to\\r\\ngo, like Mary\\'s little lamb. Button-Bright didn\\'t seem a bit afraid or\\r\\nworried because he was lost, and the shaggy man had no home, perhaps,\\r\\nand was as happy in one place as in another.\\nBefore long they saw ahead of them a fine big arch spanning the road,\\r\\nand when they came nearer they found that the arch was beautifully\\r\\ncarved and decorated with rich colors. A row of peacocks with spread\\r\\ntails ran along the top of it, and all the feathers were gorgeously\\r\\npainted. In the center was a large fox\\'s head, and the fox wore a shrewd\\r\\nand knowing expression and had large spectacles over its eyes and a\\r\\nsmall golden crown with shiny points on top of its head.\\nWhile the travellers were looking with curiosity at this beautiful arch\\r\\nthere suddenly marched out of it a company of soldiers—only the\\r\\nsoldiers were all foxes dressed in uniforms. They wore green jackets and\\r\\nyellow pantaloons, and their little round caps and their high boots were\\r\\na bright red color. Also there was a big red bow tied about the middle\\r\\nof each long, bushy tail. Each soldier was armed with a wooden sword\\r\\nhaving an edge of sharp teeth set in a row, and the sight of these teeth\\r\\nat first caused Dorothy to shudder.\\nA captain marched in front of the company of fox-soldiers, his uniform\\r\\nembroidered with gold braid to make it handsomer than the others.\\nAlmost before our friends realized it the soldiers had surrounded them\\r\\non all sides, and the captain was calling out in a harsh voice:\\n\"Surrender! You are our prisoners.\"\\n\"What\\'s a pris\\'ner?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"A prisoner is a captive,\" replied the fox-captain, strutting up and\\r\\ndown with much dignity.\\n\"What\\'s a captive?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"You\\'re one,\" said the captain.\\nThat made the shaggy man laugh.\\n\"Good afternoon, captain,\" he said, bowing politely to all the foxes and\\r\\nvery low to their commander. \"I trust you are in good health, and that\\r\\nyour families are all well?\"\\nThe fox-captain looked at the shaggy man, and his sharp features grew\\r\\npleasant and smiling.\\n\"We\\'re pretty well, thank you, Shaggy Man,\" said he; and Dorothy knew\\r\\nthat the Love Magnet was working and that all the foxes now loved the\\r\\nshaggy man because of it. But Toto didn\\'t know this, for he began\\r\\nbarking angrily and tried to bite the captain\\'s hairy leg where it\\r\\nshowed between his red boots and his yellow pantaloons.\\n\"Stop, Toto!\" cried the little girl, seizing the dog in her arms. \"These\\r\\nare our friends.\"\\n\"Why, so we are!\" remarked the captain in tones of astonishment. \"I\\r\\nthought at first we were enemies, but it seems you are friends, instead.\\r\\nYou must come with me to see King Dox.\"\\n\"Who\\'s he?\" asked Button-Bright, with earnest eyes.\\n\"King Dox of Foxville; the great and wise sovereign who rules over our\\r\\ncommunity.\"\\n\\n\"What\\'s sov\\'rin, and what\\'s c\\'u\\'nity?\" inquired Button-Bright.\\n\"Don\\'t ask so many questions, little boy.\"\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"Ah, why, indeed?\" exclaimed the captain, looking at Button-Bright\\r\\nadmiringly. \"If you don\\'t ask questions you will learn nothing. True\\r\\nenough. I was wrong. You\\'re a very clever little boy, come to think of\\r\\nit—very clever indeed. But now, friends, please come with me, for it is\\r\\nmy duty to escort you at once to the royal palace.\"\\nThe soldiers marched back through the arch again, and with them marched\\r\\nthe shaggy man, Dorothy, Toto, and Button-Bright. Once through the\\r\\nopening they found a fine, big city spread out before them, all the\\r\\nhouses of carved marble in beautiful colors. The decorations were mostly\\r\\nbirds and other fowl, such as peacocks, pheasants, turkeys,\\r\\nprairie-chickens, ducks, and geese. Over each doorway was carved a head\\r\\nrepresenting the fox who lived in that house, this effect being quite\\r\\npretty and unusual.\\nAs our friends marched along, some of the foxes came out on the porches\\r\\nand balconies to get a view of the strangers. These foxes were all\\r\\nhandsomely dressed, the girl-foxes and women-foxes wearing gowns of\\r\\nfeathers woven together effectively and colored in bright hues which\\r\\nDorothy thought were quite artistic and decidedly attractive.\\nButton-Bright stared until his eyes were big and round, and he would\\r\\nhave stumbled and fallen more than once had not the shaggy man grasped\\r\\nhis hand tightly. They were all interested, and Toto was so excited he\\r\\nwanted to bark every minute and to chase and fight every fox he caught\\r\\nsight of; but Dorothy held his little wiggling body fast in her arms and\\r\\ncommanded him to be good and behave himself. So he finally quieted down,\\r\\nlike a wise doggy, deciding there were too many foxes in Foxville to\\r\\nfight at one time.\\nBy-and-bye they came to a big square, and in the center of the square\\r\\nstood the royal palace. Dorothy knew it at once because it had over its\\r\\ngreat door the carved head of a fox just like the one she had seen on\\r\\nthe arch, and this fox was the only one who wore a golden crown.\\nThere were many fox-soldiers guarding the door, but they bowed to the\\r\\ncaptain and admitted him without question. The captain led them through\\r\\nmany rooms, where richly dressed foxes were sitting on beautiful chairs\\r\\nor sipping tea, which was being passed around by fox-servants in white\\r\\naprons. They came to a big doorway covered with heavy curtains of cloth\\r\\nof gold.\\nBeside this doorway stood a huge drum. The fox-captain went to this drum\\r\\nand knocked his knees against it—first one knee and then the other—so\\r\\nthat the drum said; \"Boom-boom.\"\\n\"You must all do exactly what I do,\" ordered the captain; so the shaggy\\r\\nman pounded the drum with his knees, and so did Dorothy and so did\\r\\nButton-Bright. The boy wanted to keep on pounding it with his little fat\\r\\nknees, because he liked the sound of it; but the captain stopped him.\\r\\nToto couldn\\'t pound the drum with his knees and he didn\\'t know enough to\\r\\nwag his tail against it, so Dorothy pounded the drum for him and that\\r\\nmade him bark, and when the little dog barked the fox-captain scowled.\\nThe golden curtains drew back far enough to make an opening, through\\r\\nwhich marched the captain with the others.\\nThe broad, long room they entered was decorated in gold with\\r\\nstained-glass windows of splendid colors. In the center of the room,\\r\\nupon a richly carved golden throne, sat the fox-king, surrounded by a\\r\\ngroup of other foxes, all of whom wore great spectacles over their eyes,\\r\\nmaking them look solemn and important.\\n\\nDorothy knew the King at once, because she had seen his head carved on\\r\\nthe arch and over the doorway of the palace. Having met with several\\r\\nother kings in her travels she knew what to do, and at once made a low\\r\\nbow before the throne. The shaggy man bowed, too, and Button-Bright\\r\\nbobbed his head and said \"Hello.\"\\n\"Most wise and noble Potentate of Foxville,\" said the captain,\\r\\naddressing the King in a pompous voice, \"I humbly beg to report that I\\r\\nfound these strangers on the road leading to your Foxy Majesty\\'s\\r\\ndominions, and have therefore brought them before you, as is my duty.\"\\n\"So—so,\" said the King, looking at them keenly. \"What brought you here,\\r\\nstrangers?\"\\n\"Our legs, may it please your Royal Hairiness,\" replied the shaggy man.\\n\"What is your business here?\" was the next question.\\n\"To get away as soon as possible,\" said the shaggy man.\\nThe King didn\\'t know about the Magnet, of course; but it made him love\\r\\nthe shaggy man at once.\\n\"Do just as you please about going away,\" he said; \"but I\\'d like to\\r\\nshow you the sights of my city and to entertain your party while you\\r\\nare here. We feel highly honored to have little Dorothy with us, I\\r\\nassure you, and we appreciate her kindness in making us a visit. For\\r\\nwhatever country Dorothy visits is sure to become famous.\"\\nThis speech greatly surprised the little girl, who asked:\\n\"How did your Majesty know my name?\"\\n\"Why, everybody knows you, my dear,\" said the Fox-King. \"Don\\'t you\\r\\nrealize that? You are quite an important personage since Princess Ozma\\r\\nof Oz made you her friend.\"\\n\"Do you know Ozma?\" she asked, wondering.\\n\"I regret to say that I do not,\" he answered, sadly; \"but I hope to\\r\\nmeet her soon. You know the Princess Ozma is to celebrate her birthday\\r\\non the twenty-first of this month.\"\\n\"Is she?\" said Dorothy. \"I didn\\'t know that.\"\\n\"Yes; it is to be the most brilliant royal ceremony ever held in any\\r\\ncity in Fairyland, and I hope you will try to get me an invitation.\"\\nDorothy thought a moment.\\n\"I\\'m sure Ozma would invite you if I asked her,\" she said; \"but how\\r\\ncould you get to the Land of Oz and the Emerald City? It\\'s a good way\\r\\nfrom Kansas.\"\\n\"Kansas!\" he exclaimed, surprised.\\n\"Why, yes; we are in Kansas now, aren\\'t we?\" she returned.\\n\\n\"What a queer notion!\" cried the Fox-King, beginning to laugh. \"Whatever\\r\\nmade you think this is Kansas?\"\\n\"I left Uncle Henry\\'s farm only about two hours ago; that\\'s the reason,\"\\r\\nshe said, rather perplexed.\\n\"But, tell me, my dear, did you ever see so wonderful a city as Foxville\\r\\nin Kansas?\" he questioned.\\n\"No, your Majesty.\"\\n\"And haven\\'t you traveled from Oz to Kansas in less than half a jiffy,\\r\\nby means of the Silver Shoes and the Magic Belt?\"\\n\"Yes, your Majesty,\" she acknowledged.\\n\"Then why do you wonder that an hour or two could bring you to Foxville,\\r\\nwhich is nearer to Oz than it is to Kansas?\"\\n\"Dear me!\" exclaimed Dorothy; \"is this another fairy adventure?\"\\n\"It seems to be,\" said the Fox-King, smiling.\\nDorothy turned to the shaggy man, and her face was grave and\\r\\nreproachful.\\n\"Are you a magician? or a fairy in disguise?\" she asked. \"Did you\\r\\nenchant me when you asked the way to Butterfield?\"\\nThe shaggy man shook his head.\\n\"Who ever heard of a shaggy fairy?\" he replied. \"No, Dorothy, my dear;\\r\\nI\\'m not to blame for this journey in any way, I assure you. There\\'s\\r\\nbeen something strange about me ever since I owned the Love Magnet; but\\r\\nI don\\'t know what it is any more than you do. I didn\\'t try to get you\\r\\naway from home, at all. If you want to find your way back to the farm\\r\\nI\\'ll go with you willingly, and do my best to help you.\"\\n\"Never mind,\" said the little girl, thoughtfully. \"There isn\\'t so much\\r\\nto see in Kansas as there is here, and I guess Aunt Em won\\'t be very\\r\\nmuch worried; that is, if I don\\'t stay away too long.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s right,\" declared the Fox-King, nodding approval. \"Be contented\\r\\nwith your lot, whatever it happens to be, if you are wise. Which reminds\\r\\nme that you have a new companion on this adventure—he looks very\\r\\nclever and bright.\"\\n\"He is,\" said Dorothy; and the shaggy man added:\\n\"That\\'s his name, your Royal Foxiness—Button Bright.\"\\n\\n\\nIT was amusing to note the expression on the face of King Dox as he\\r\\nlooked the boy over, from his sailor hat to his stubby shoes; and it was\\r\\nequally diverting to watch Button-Bright stare at the King in return. No\\r\\nfox ever beheld a fresher, fairer child\\'s face, and no child had ever\\r\\nbefore heard a fox talk, or met with one who dressed so handsomely and\\r\\nruled so big a city. I am sorry to say that no one had ever told the\\r\\nlittle boy much about fairies of any kind; this being the case, it is\\r\\neasy to understand how much this strange experience startled and\\r\\nastonished him.\\n\"How do you like us?\" asked the King.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Of course you don\\'t. It\\'s too short an acquaintance,\" returned his\\r\\nMajesty. \"What do you suppose my name is?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"How should you? Well, I\\'ll tell you. My private name is Dox, but a King\\r\\ncan\\'t be called by his private name; he has to take one that is\\r\\nofficial. Therefore my official name is King Renard the Fourth. Ren-ard\\r\\nwith the accent on the \\'Ren\\'.\"\\n\"What\\'s \\'ren\\'?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"How clever!\" exclaimed the King, turning a pleased face toward his\\r\\ncounselors. \"This boy is indeed remarkably bright. \\'What\\'s \\'ren\\'\\'? he\\r\\nasks; and of course \\'ren\\' is nothing at all, all by itself. Yes; he\\'s\\r\\nvery bright indeed.\"\\n\"That question is what your Majesty might call foxy,\" said one of the\\r\\ncounselors, an old grey fox.\\n\"So it is,\" declared the King. Turning again to Button-Bright, he asked:\\n\"Having told you my name, what would you call me?\"\\n\"King Dox,\" said the boy.\\n\"Why?\"\\n\"\\'Cause \\'ren\\'\\'s nothing at all,\" was the reply.\\n\"Good! Very good indeed! You certainly have a brilliant mind. Do you\\r\\nknow why two and two make four?\"\\n\"No,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Clever! clever indeed. Of course you don\\'t know. Nobody knows why; we\\r\\nonly know it\\'s so, and can\\'t tell why it\\'s so. Button-Bright, those\\r\\ncurls and blue eyes do not go well with so much wisdom. They make you\\r\\nlook too youthful, and hide your real cleverness. Therefore, I will do\\r\\nyou a great favor. I will confer upon you the head of a fox, so that you\\r\\nmay hereafter look as bright as you really are.\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the King waved his paw toward the boy, and at once the\\r\\npretty curls and fresh round face and big blue eyes were gone, while in\\r\\ntheir place a fox\\'s head appeared upon Button-Bright\\'s shoulders—a\\r\\nhairy head with a sharp nose, pointed ears, and keen little eyes.\\n\"Oh, don\\'t do that!\" cried Dorothy, shrinking back from her transformed\\r\\ncompanion with a shocked and dismayed face.\\n\"Too late, my dear; it\\'s done. But you also shall have a fox\\'s head if\\r\\nyou can prove you\\'re as clever as Button-Bright.\"\\n\"I don\\'t want it; it\\'s dreadful!\" she exclaimed; and, hearing this\\r\\nverdict, Button-Bright began to boo-hoo just as if he were still a\\r\\nlittle boy.\\n\"How can you call that lovely head dreadful?\" asked the King. \"It\\'s a\\r\\nmuch prettier face than he had before, to my notion, and my wife says\\r\\nI\\'m a good judge of beauty. Don\\'t cry, little fox-boy. Laugh and be\\r\\nproud, because you are so highly favored. How do you like the new head,\\r\\nButton-Bright?\"\\n\"D-d-don\\'t n-n-n-know!\" sobbed the child.\\n\"Please, please change him back again, your Majesty!\" begged Dorothy.\\nKing Renard IV shook his head.\\n\"I can\\'t do that,\" he said; \"I haven\\'t the power, even if I wanted to.\\r\\nNo, Button-Bright must wear his fox head, and he\\'ll be sure to love it\\r\\ndearly as soon as he gets used to it.\"\\nBoth the shaggy man and Dorothy looked grave and anxious, for they were\\r\\nsorrowful that such a misfortune had overtaken their little companion.\\r\\nToto barked at the fox-boy once or twice, not realizing it was his\\r\\nformer friend who now wore the animal head; but Dorothy cuffed the dog\\r\\nand made him stop. As for the foxes, they all seemed to think\\r\\nButton-Bright\\'s new head very becoming and that their King had conferred\\r\\na great honor on this little stranger.\\nIt was funny to see the boy reach up to feel of his sharp nose and wide\\r\\nmouth, and wail afresh with grief. He wagged his ears in a comical\\r\\nmanner and tears were in his little black eyes. But Dorothy couldn\\'t\\r\\nlaugh at her friend just yet, because she felt so sorry.\\nJust then three little fox-princesses, daughters of the King, entered\\r\\nthe room, and when they saw Button-Bright one exclaimed: \"How lovely he\\r\\nis!\" and the next one cried in delight: \"How sweet he is!\" and the third\\r\\nprincess clapped her hands with pleasure and said, \"How beautiful he\\r\\nis!\"\\nButton-Bright stopped crying and asked timidly:\\n\"Am I?\"\\n\"In all the world there is not another face so pretty,\" declared the\\r\\nbiggest fox-princess.\\n\"You must live with us always, and be our brother,\" said the next.\\n\"We shall all love you dearly,\" the third said.\\nThis praise did much to comfort the boy, and he looked around and tried\\r\\nto smile. It was a pitiful attempt, because the fox face was new and\\r\\nstiff, and Dorothy thought his expression more stupid than before the\\r\\ntransformation.\\n\"I think we ought to be going now,\" said the shaggy man, uneasily, for\\r\\nhe didn\\'t know what the King might take into his head to do next.\\n\"Don\\'t leave us yet, I beg of you,\" pleaded King Renard. \"I intend to\\r\\nhave several days of feasting and merrymaking, in honor of your visit.\"\\n\"Have it after we\\'re gone, for we can\\'t wait,\" said Dorothy, decidedly.\\r\\nBut seeing this displeased the King, she added: \"If I\\'m going to get\\r\\nOzma to invite you to her party I\\'ll have to find her as soon as\\r\\nposs\\'ble, you know.\"\\nIn spite of all the beauty of Foxville and the gorgeous dresses of its\\r\\ninhabitants, both the girl and the shaggy man felt they were not quite\\r\\nsafe there, and would be glad to see the last of it.\\n\"But it is now evening,\" the King reminded them, \"and you must stay with\\r\\nus until morning, anyhow. Therefore I invite you to be my guests at\\r\\ndinner, and to attend the theater afterward and sit in the royal box.\\r\\nTo-morrow morning, if you really insist upon it, you may resume your\\r\\njourney.\"\\nThey consented to this, and some of the fox-servants led them to a suite\\r\\nof lovely rooms in the big palace.\\nButton-Bright was afraid to be left alone, so Dorothy took him into her\\r\\nown room. While a maid-fox dressed the little girl\\'s hair—which was a\\r\\nbit tangled—and put some bright, fresh ribbons in it, another maid-fox\\r\\ncombed the hair on poor Button-Bright\\'s face and head and brushed it\\r\\ncarefully, tying a pink bow to each of his pointed ears. The maids\\r\\nwanted to dress the children in fine costumes of woven feathers, such as\\r\\nall the foxes wore; but neither of them consented to that.\\n\\n\"A sailor suit and a fox head do not go well together,\" said one of the\\r\\nmaids; \"for no fox was ever a sailor that I can remember.\"\\n\"I\\'m not a fox!\" cried Button-Bright.\\n\"Alas, no,\" agreed the maid. \"But you\\'ve got a lovely fox head on your\\r\\nskinny shoulders, and that\\'s almost as good as being a fox.\"\\nThe boy, reminded of his misfortune, began to cry again. Dorothy petted\\r\\nand comforted him and promised to find some way to restore him his own\\r\\nhead.\\n\"If we can manage to get to Ozma,\" she said, \"the Princess will change\\r\\nyou back to yourself in half a second; so you just wear that fox head as\\r\\ncomf\\'t\\'bly as you can, dear, and don\\'t worry about it at all. It isn\\'t\\r\\nnearly as pretty as your own head, no matter what the foxes say; but you\\r\\ncan get along with it for a little while longer, can\\'t you?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright, doubtfully; but he didn\\'t cry any more\\r\\nafter that.\\nDorothy let the maids pin ribbons to her shoulders, after which they\\r\\nwere ready for the King\\'s dinner. When they met the shaggy man in the\\r\\nsplendid drawing-room of the palace they found him just the same as\\r\\nbefore. He had refused to give up his shaggy clothes for new ones,\\r\\nbecause if he did that he would no longer be the shaggy man, he said,\\r\\nand he might have to get acquainted with himself all over again.\\nHe told Dorothy he had brushed his shaggy hair and whiskers; but she\\r\\nthought he must have brushed them the wrong way, for they were quite as\\r\\nshaggy as before.\\nAs for the company of foxes assembled to dine with the strangers, they\\r\\nwere most beautifully costumed, and their rich dresses made Dorothy\\'s\\r\\nsimple gown and Button-Bright\\'s sailor suit and the shaggy man\\'s shaggy\\r\\nclothes look commonplace. But they treated their guests with great\\r\\nrespect and the King\\'s dinner was a very good dinner indeed.\\nFoxes, as you know, are fond of chicken and other fowl; so they served\\r\\nchicken soup and roasted turkey and stewed duck and fried grouse and\\r\\nbroiled quail and goose pie, and as the cooking was excellent the King\\'s\\r\\nguests enjoyed the meal and ate heartily of the various dishes.\\nThe party went to the theater, where they saw a play acted by foxes\\r\\ndressed in costumes of brilliantly colored feathers. The play was about\\r\\na fox-girl who was stolen by some wicked wolves and carried to their\\r\\ncave; and just as they were about to kill her and eat her a company of\\r\\nfox-soldiers marched up, saved the girl, and put all the wicked wolves\\r\\nto death.\\n\"How do you like it?\" the King asked Dorothy.\\n\"Pretty well,\" she answered. \"It reminds me of one of Mr. Aesop\\'s\\r\\nfables.\"\\n\"Don\\'t mention Aesop to me, I beg of you!\" exclaimed King Dox. \"I hate\\r\\nthat man\\'s name. He wrote a good deal about foxes, but always made them\\r\\nout cruel and wicked, whereas we are gentle and kind, as you may see.\"\\n\"But his fables showed you to be wise and clever, and more shrewd than\\r\\nother animals,\" said the shaggy man, thoughtfully.\\n\\n\"So we are. There is no question about our knowing more than men do,\"\\r\\nreplied the King, proudly. \"But we employ our wisdom to do good, instead\\r\\nof harm; so that horrid Aesop did not know what he was talking about.\"\\nThey did not like to contradict him, because they felt he ought to know\\r\\nthe nature of foxes better than men did; so they sat still and watched\\r\\nthe play, and Button-Bright became so interested that for the time he\\r\\nforgot he wore a fox head.\\nAfterward they went back to the palace and slept in soft beds stuffed\\r\\nwith feathers; for the foxes raised many fowl for food, and used their\\r\\nfeathers for clothing and to sleep upon.\\nDorothy wondered why the animals living in Foxville did not wear just\\r\\ntheir own hairy skins, as wild foxes do; when she mentioned it to King\\r\\nDox he said they clothed themselves because they were civilized.\\n\"But you were born without clothes,\" she observed, \"and you don\\'t seem\\r\\nto me to need them.\"\\n\"So were human beings born without clothes,\" he replied; \"and until they\\r\\nbecame civilized they wore only their natural skins. But to become\\r\\ncivilized means to dress as elaborately and prettily as possible, and to\\r\\nmake a show of your clothes so your neighbors will envy you, and for\\r\\nthat reason both civilized foxes and civilized humans spend most of\\r\\ntheir time dressing themselves.\"\\n\"I don\\'t,\" declared the shaggy man.\\n\"That is true,\" said the King, looking at him carefully: \"but perhaps\\r\\nyou are not civilized.\"\\nAfter a sound sleep and a good night\\'s rest they had their breakfast\\r\\nwith the King and then bade his Majesty good-bye.\\n\"You\\'ve been kind to us—\\'cept poor Button-Bright,\" said Dorothy, \"and\\r\\nwe\\'ve had a nice time in Foxville.\"\\n\"Then,\" said King Dox, \"perhaps you\\'ll be good enough to get me an\\r\\ninvitation to Princess Ozma\\'s birthday celebration.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" she promised; \"if I see her in time.\"\\n\"It\\'s on the twenty-first, remember,\" he continued; \"and if you\\'ll just\\r\\nsee that I\\'m invited I\\'ll find a way to cross the Dreadful Desert into\\r\\nthe marvelous Land of Oz. I\\'ve always wanted to visit the Emerald City,\\r\\nso I\\'m sure it was fortunate you arrived here just when you did, you\\r\\nbeing Princess Ozma\\'s friend and able to assist me in getting the\\r\\ninvitation.\"\\n\"If I see Ozma I\\'ll ask her to invite you,\" she replied.\\nThe Fox-King had a delightful luncheon put up for them, which the shaggy\\r\\nman shoved in his pocket, and the fox-captain escorted them to an arch\\r\\nat the side of the village opposite the one by which they had entered.\\r\\nHere they found more soldiers guarding the road.\\n\"Are you afraid of enemies?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"No; because we are watchful and able to protect ourselves,\" answered\\r\\nthe captain. \"But this road leads to another village peopled by big,\\r\\nstupid beasts who might cause us trouble if they thought we were afraid\\r\\nof them.\"\\n\"What beasts are they?\" asked the shaggy man.\\nThe captain hesitated to answer. Finally he said:\\n\"You will learn all about them when you arrive at their city. But do not\\r\\nbe afraid of them. Button-Bright is so wonderfully clever and has now\\r\\nsuch an intelligent face that I\\'m sure he will manage to find a way to\\r\\nprotect you.\"\\nThis made Dorothy and the shaggy man rather uneasy, for they had not so\\r\\nmuch confidence in the fox-boy\\'s wisdom as the captain seemed to have.\\r\\nBut as their escort would say no more about the beasts, they bade him\\r\\ngood-bye and proceeded on their journey.\\n\\n\\n\\nTOTO, now allowed to run about as he pleased, was glad to be free again\\r\\nand able to bark at the birds and chase the butterflies. The country\\r\\naround them was charming, yet in the pretty fields of wild-flowers and\\r\\ngroves of leafy trees were no houses whatever, or sign of any\\r\\ninhabitants. Birds flew through the air and cunning white rabbits darted\\r\\namongst the tall grasses and green bushes; Dorothy noticed even the ants\\r\\ntoiling busily along the roadway, bearing gigantic loads of clover seed;\\r\\nbut of people there were none at all.\\nThey walked briskly on for an hour or two, for even little Button-Bright\\r\\nwas a good walker and did not tire easily. At length as they turned a\\r\\ncurve in the road they beheld just before them a curious sight.\\nA little girl, radiant and beautiful, shapely as a fairy and exquisitely\\r\\ndressed, was dancing gracefully in the middle of the lonely road,\\r\\nwhirling slowly this way and that, her dainty feet twinkling in\\r\\nsprightly fashion. She was clad in flowing, fluffy robes of soft\\r\\nmaterial that reminded Dorothy of woven cobwebs, only it was colored in\\r\\nsoft tintings of violet, rose, topaz, olive, azure, and white, mingled\\r\\ntogether most harmoniously in stripes which melted one into the other\\r\\nwith soft blendings. Her hair was like spun gold and floated around her\\r\\nin a cloud, no strand being fastened or confined by either pin or\\r\\nornament or ribbon.\\nFilled with wonder and admiration our friends approached and stood\\r\\nwatching this fascinating dance. The girl was no taller than Dorothy,\\r\\nalthough more slender; nor did she seem any older than our little\\r\\nheroine.\\nSuddenly she paused and abandoned the dance, as if for the first time\\r\\nobserving the presence of strangers. As she faced them, shy as a\\r\\nfrightened fawn, poised upon one foot as if to fly the next instant,\\r\\nDorothy was astonished to see tears flowing from her violet eyes and\\r\\ntrickling down her lovely rose-hued cheeks. That the dainty maiden\\r\\nshould dance and weep at the same time was indeed surprising; so Dorothy\\r\\nasked in a soft, sympathetic voice:\\nPOLYCHROME—THE RAINBOW\\'S DAUGHTER\\n\"Are you unhappy, little girl?\"\\n\"Very!\" was the reply; \"I am lost.\"\\n\"Why, so are we,\" said Dorothy, smiling; \"but we don\\'t cry about it.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you? Why not?\"\\n\"\\'Cause I\\'ve been lost before, and always got found again,\" answered\\r\\nDorothy, simply.\\n\"But I\\'ve never been lost before,\" murmured the dainty maiden, \"and I\\'m\\r\\nworried and afraid.\"\\n\"You were dancing,\" remarked Dorothy, in a puzzled tone of voice.\\n\"Oh, that was just to keep warm,\" explained the maiden, quickly. \"It was\\r\\nnot because I felt happy or gay, I assure you.\"\\nDorothy looked at her closely. Her gauzy flowing robes might not be very\\r\\nwarm, yet the weather wasn\\'t at all chilly, but rather mild and balmy,\\r\\nlike a spring day.\\n\"Who are you, dear?\" she asked, gently.\\n\"I\\'m Polychrome,\" was the reply.\\n\"Polly whom?\"\\n\"Polychrome. I\\'m the Daughter of the Rainbow.\"\\n\"Oh!\" said Dorothy, with a gasp; \"I didn\\'t know the Rainbow had\\r\\nchildren. But I might have known it, before you spoke. You couldn\\'t\\r\\nreally be anything else.\"\\n\"Why not?\" inquired Polychrome, as if surprised.\\n\"Because you\\'re so lovely and sweet.\"\\nThe little maiden smiled through her tears, came up to Dorothy, and\\r\\nplaced her slender fingers in the Kansas girl\\'s chubby hand.\\n\"You\\'ll be my friend—won\\'t you?\" she said, pleadingly.\\n\\n\"Of course.\"\\n\"And what is your name?\"\\n\"I\\'m Dorothy; and this is my friend Shaggy Man, who owns the Love\\r\\nMagnet; and this is Button-Bright—only you don\\'t see him as he really\\r\\nis because the Fox-King carelessly changed his head into a fox head. But\\r\\nthe real Button-Bright is good to look at, and I hope to get him changed\\r\\nback to himself, some time.\"\\nThe Rainbow\\'s Daughter nodded cheerfully, no longer afraid of her new\\r\\ncompanions.\\n\"But who is this?\" she asked, pointing to Toto, who was sitting before\\r\\nher wagging his tail in the most friendly manner and admiring the pretty\\r\\nmaid with his bright eyes. \"Is this, also, some enchanted person?\"\\n\"Oh no, Polly—I may call you Polly, mayn\\'t I? Your whole name\\'s awful\\r\\nhard to say.\"\\n\"Call me Polly if you wish, Dorothy.\"\\n\"Well, Polly, Toto\\'s just a dog; but he has more sense than\\r\\nButton-Bright, to tell the truth; and I\\'m very fond of him.\"\\n\"So am I,\" said Polychrome, bending gracefully to pat Toto\\'s head.\\n\"But how did the Rainbow\\'s Daughter ever get on this lonely road, and\\r\\nbecome lost?\" asked the shaggy man, who had listened wonderingly to all\\r\\nthis.\\n\"Why, my father stretched his rainbow over here this morning, so that\\r\\none end of it touched this road,\" was the reply; \"and I was dancing upon\\r\\nthe pretty rays, as I love to do, and never noticed I was getting too\\r\\nfar over the bend in the circle. Suddenly I began to slide, and I went\\r\\nfaster and faster until at last I bumped on the ground, at the very end.\\r\\nJust then father lifted the rainbow again, without noticing me at all,\\r\\nand though I tried to seize the end of it and hold fast, it melted away\\r\\nentirely and I was left alone and helpless on the cold, hard earth!\"\\n\"It doesn\\'t seem cold to me, Polly,\" said Dorothy; \"but perhaps you\\'re\\r\\nnot warmly dressed.\"\\n\"I\\'m so used to living nearer the sun,\" replied the Rainbow\\'s Daughter,\\r\\n\"that at first I feared I would freeze down here. But my dance has\\r\\nwarmed me some, and now I wonder how I am ever to get home again.\"\\n\"Won\\'t your father miss you, and look for you, and let down another\\r\\nrainbow for you?\"\\n\\n\"Perhaps so; but he\\'s busy just now because it rains in so many parts of\\r\\nthe world at this season, and he has to set his rainbow in a lot of\\r\\ndifferent places. What would you advise me to do, Dorothy?\"\\n\"Come with us,\" was the answer. \"I\\'m going to try to find my way to the\\r\\nEmerald City, which is in the fairy Land of Oz. The Emerald City is\\r\\nruled by a friend of mine, the Princess Ozma, and if we can manage to\\r\\nget there I\\'m sure she will know a way to send you home to your father\\r\\nagain.\"\\n\"Do you really think so?\" asked Polychrome, anxiously.\\n\"I\\'m pretty sure.\"\\n\"Then I\\'ll go with you,\" said the little maid; \"for travel will help\\r\\nkeep me warm, and father can find me in one part of the world as well as\\r\\nanother—if he gets time to look for me.\"\\n\"Come along, then,\" said the shaggy man, cheerfully; and they started on\\r\\nonce more. Polly walked beside Dorothy a while, holding her new friend\\'s\\r\\nhand as if she feared to let it go; but her nature seemed as light and\\r\\nbuoyant as her fleecy robes, for suddenly she darted ahead and whirled\\r\\nround in a giddy dance. Then she tripped back to them with sparkling\\r\\neyes and smiling cheeks, having regained her usual happy mood and\\r\\nforgotten all her worry about being lost.\\nThey found her a charming companion, and her dancing and laughter—for\\r\\nshe laughed at times like the tinkling of a silver bell—did much to\\r\\nenliven their journey and keep them contented.\\n\\n\\nWHEN noon came they opened the Fox-King\\'s basket of luncheon, and found\\r\\na nice roasted turkey with cranberry sauce and some slices of bread and\\r\\nbutter. As they sat on the grass by the roadside the shaggy man cut up\\r\\nthe turkey with his pocket-knife and passed slices of it around.\\n\"Haven\\'t you any dewdrops, or mist-cakes, or cloud-buns?\" asked\\r\\nPolychrome, longingly.\\n\"\\'Course not,\" replied Dorothy. \"We eat solid things, down here on the\\r\\nearth. But there\\'s a bottle of cold tea. Try some, won\\'t you?\"\\nThe Rainbow\\'s Daughter watched Button-Bright devour one leg of the\\r\\nturkey.\\n\"Is it good?\" she asked.\\nHe nodded.\\n\"Do you think I could eat it?\"\\n\"Not this,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"But I mean another piece?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" he replied.\\n\"Well, I\\'m going to try, for I\\'m very hungry,\" she decided, and took a\\r\\nthin slice of the white breast of turkey which the shaggy man cut for\\r\\nher, as well as a bit of bread and butter. When she tasted it Polychrome\\r\\nthought the turkey was good—better even than mist-cakes; but a little\\r\\nsatisfied her hunger and she finished with a tiny sip of cold tea.\\n\"That\\'s about as much as a fly would eat,\" said Dorothy, who was making\\r\\na good meal herself. \"But I know some people in Oz who eat nothing at\\r\\nall.\"\\n\"Who are they?\" inquired the shaggy man.\\n\"One is a scarecrow who\\'s stuffed with straw, and the other a woodman\\r\\nmade out of tin. They haven\\'t any appetites inside of \\'em, you see; so\\r\\nthey never eat anything at all.\"\\n\"Are they alive?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"Oh yes,\" replied Dorothy; \"and they\\'re very clever and very nice, too.\\r\\nIf we get to Oz I\\'ll introduce them to you.\"\\n\"Do you really expect to get to Oz?\" inquired the shaggy man, taking a\\r\\ndrink of cold tea.\\nPOLLY SIPPED A LITTLE COLD TEA\\n\"I don\\'t know just what to \\'spect,\" answered the child, seriously;\\r\\n\"but I\\'ve noticed if I happen to get lost I\\'m almost sure to come to the\\r\\nLand of Oz in the end, somehow \\'r other; so I may get there this time.\\r\\nBut I can\\'t promise, you know; all I can do is wait and see.\"\\n\"Will the Scarecrow scare me?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"No; \\'cause you\\'re not a crow,\" she returned. \"He has the loveliest\\r\\nsmile you ever saw—only it\\'s painted on and he can\\'t help it.\"\\nLuncheon being over they started again upon their journey, the shaggy\\r\\nman, Dorothy and Button-Bright walking soberly along, side by side, and\\r\\nthe Rainbow\\'s Daughter dancing merrily before them.\\nSometimes she darted along the road so swiftly that she was nearly out\\r\\nof sight, then she came tripping back to greet them with her silvery\\r\\nlaughter. But once she came back more sedately, to say:\\n\"There\\'s a city a little way off.\"\\n\"I \\'spected that,\" returned Dorothy; \"for the fox-people warned us there\\r\\nwas one on this road. It\\'s filled with stupid beasts of some sort, but\\r\\nwe mustn\\'t be afraid of \\'em \\'cause they won\\'t hurt us.\"\\n\"All right,\" said Button-Bright; but Polychrome didn\\'t know whether it\\r\\nwas all right or not.\\n\"It\\'s a big city,\" she said, \"and the road runs straight through it.\"\\n\"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man; \"as long as I carry the Love Magnet\\r\\nevery living thing will love me, and you may be sure I shan\\'t allow any\\r\\nof my friends to be harmed in any way.\"\\nThis comforted them somewhat, and they moved on again. Pretty soon they\\r\\ncame to a sign-post that read:\\n\"HAF A MYLE TO DUNKITON.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said the shaggy man, \"if they\\'re donkeys we\\'ve nothing to fear at\\r\\nall.\"\\n\"They may kick,\" said Dorothy, doubtfully.\\n\"Then we will cut some switches, and make them behave,\" he replied. At\\r\\nthe first tree he cut himself a long, slender switch from one of the\\r\\nbranches, and shorter switches for the others.\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid to order the beasts around,\" he said; \"they\\'re used to\\r\\nit.\"\\nBefore long the road brought them to the gates of the city. There was a\\r\\nhigh wall all around, which had been whitewashed, and the gate just\\r\\nbefore our travelers was a mere opening in the wall, with no bars across\\r\\nit. No towers or steeples or domes showed above the enclosure, nor was\\r\\nany living thing to be seen as our friends drew near.\\nSuddenly, as they were about to boldly enter through the opening, there\\r\\narose a harsh clamor of sound that swelled and echoed on every side,\\r\\nuntil they were nearly deafened by the racket and had to put their\\r\\nfingers to their ears to keep the noise out.\\nIt was like the firing of many cannon, only there were no cannon-balls\\r\\nor other missiles to be seen; it was like the rolling of mighty thunder,\\r\\nonly not a cloud was in the sky; it was like the roar of countless\\r\\nbreakers on a rugged seashore, only there was no sea or other water\\r\\nanywhere about.\\nThey hesitated to advance; but, as the noise did no harm, they entered\\r\\nthrough the whitewashed wall and quickly discovered the cause of the\\r\\nturmoil. Inside were suspended many sheets of tin or thin iron, and\\r\\nagainst these metal sheets a row of donkeys were pounding their heels\\r\\nwith vicious kicks.\\n\\nThe shaggy man ran up to the nearest donkey and gave the beast a sharp\\r\\nblow with his switch.\\n\"Stop that noise!\" he shouted; and the donkey stopped kicking the metal\\r\\nsheet and turned its head to look with surprise at the shaggy man. He\\r\\nswitched the next donkey, and made him stop, and then the next, so that\\r\\ngradually the rattling of heels ceased and the awful noise subsided. The\\r\\ndonkeys stood in a group and eyed the strangers with fear and trembling.\\n\"What do you mean by making such a racket?\" asked the shaggy man,\\r\\nsternly.\\n\"We were scaring away the foxes,\" said one of the donkeys, meekly.\\r\\n\"Usually they run fast enough when they hear the noise, which makes them\\r\\nafraid.\"\\n\"There are no foxes here,\" said the shaggy man.\\n\"I beg to differ with you. There\\'s one, anyhow,\" replied the donkey,\\r\\nsitting upright on its haunches and waving a hoof toward Button-Bright.\\r\\n\"We saw him coming and thought the whole army of foxes was marching to\\r\\nattack us.\"\\n\"Button-Bright isn\\'t a fox,\" explained the shaggy man. \"He\\'s only\\r\\nwearing a fox head for a time, until he can get his own head back.\"\\n\"Oh, I see,\" remarked the donkey, waving its left ear reflectively. \"I\\'m\\r\\nsorry we made such a mistake, and had all our work and worry for\\r\\nnothing.\"\\nThe other donkeys by this time were sitting up and examining the\\r\\nstrangers with big, glassy eyes. They made a queer picture, indeed; for\\r\\nthey wore wide, white collars around their necks and the collars had\\r\\nmany scallops and points. The gentlemen-donkeys wore high pointed caps\\r\\nset between their great ears, and the lady-donkeys wore sunbonnets with\\r\\nholes cut in the top for the ears to stick through. But they had no\\r\\nother clothing except their hairy skins, although many wore gold and\\r\\nsilver bangles on their front wrists and bands of different metals on\\r\\ntheir rear ankles. When they were kicking they had braced themselves\\r\\nwith their front legs, but now they all stood or sat upright on their\\r\\nhind legs and used their front ones as arms. Having no fingers or hands\\r\\nthe beasts were rather clumsy, as you may guess; but Dorothy was\\r\\nsurprised to observe how many things they could do with their stiff,\\r\\nheavy hoofs.\\nSome of the donkeys were white, some were brown, or gray, or black, or\\r\\nspotted; but their hair was sleek and smooth and their broad collars and\\r\\ncaps gave them a neat, if whimsical, appearance.\\n\"This is a nice way to welcome visitors, I must say!\" remarked the\\r\\nshaggy man, in a reproachful tone.\\n\"Oh, we did not mean to be impolite,\" replied a grey donkey which had\\r\\nnot spoken before. \"But you were not expected, nor did you send in your\\r\\nvisiting cards, as it is proper to do.\"\\n\"There is some truth in that,\" admitted the shaggy man; \"but, now you\\r\\nare informed that we are important and distinguished travelers, I trust\\r\\nyou will accord us proper consideration.\"\\nThese big words delighted the donkeys, and made them bow to the shaggy\\r\\nman with great respect. Said the grey one:\\n\"You shall be taken before his great and glorious Majesty King\\r\\nKik-a-bray, who will greet you as becomes your exalted stations.\"\\n\"That\\'s right,\" answered Dorothy. \"Take us to some one who knows\\r\\nsomething.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, we all know something, my child, or we shouldn\\'t be donkeys,\"\\r\\nasserted the grey one, with dignity. \"The word \\'donkey\\' means \\'clever,\\'\\r\\nyou know.\"\\n\"I didn\\'t know it,\" she replied. \"I thought it meant \\'stupid\\'.\"\\n\"Not at all, my child. If you will look in the Encyclopedia Donkaniara\\r\\nyou will find I\\'m correct. But come; I will myself lead you before our\\r\\nsplendid, exalted, and most intellectual ruler.\"\\nAll donkeys love big words, so it is no wonder the grey one used so many\\r\\nof them.\\n\\n\\nTHEY found the houses of the town all low and square and built of\\r\\nbricks, neatly whitewashed inside and out. The houses were not set in\\r\\nrows, forming regular streets, but placed here and there in a haphazard\\r\\nmanner which made it puzzling for a stranger to find his way.\\n\"Stupid people must have streets and numbered houses in their cities, to\\r\\nguide them where to go,\" observed the grey donkey, as he walked before\\r\\nthe visitors on his hind legs, in an awkward but comical manner; \"but\\r\\nclever donkeys know their way about without such absurd marks. Moreover,\\r\\na mixed city is much prettier than one with straight streets.\"\\nDorothy did not agree with this, but she said nothing to contradict it.\\r\\nPresently she saw a sign on a house that read: \"Madam de Fayke,\\r\\nHoofist,\" and she asked their conductor:\\n\"What\\'s a \\'hoofist,\\' please?\"\\n\"One who reads your fortune in your hoofs,\" replied the grey donkey.\\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the little girl. \"You are quite civilized here.\"\\n\"Dunkiton,\" he replied, \"is the center of the world\\'s highest\\r\\ncivilization.\"\\nThey came to a house where two youthful donkeys were whitewashing the\\r\\nwall, and Dorothy stopped a moment to watch them. They dipped the ends\\r\\nof their tails, which were much like paint-brushes, into a pail of\\r\\nwhitewash, backed up against the house, and wagged their tails right and\\r\\nleft until the whitewash was rubbed on the wall, after which they dipped\\r\\nthese funny brushes in the pail again and repeated the performance.\\n\"That must be fun,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"No; it\\'s work,\" replied the old donkey; \"but we make our youngsters do\\r\\nall the whitewashing, to keep them out of mischief.\"\\n\"Don\\'t they go to school?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"All donkeys are born wise,\" was the reply, \"so the only school we need\\r\\nis the school of experience. Books are only fit for those who know\\r\\nnothing, and so are obliged to learn things from other people.\"\\n\\n\"In other words, the more stupid one is the more he thinks he knows,\"\\r\\nobserved the shaggy man. The grey donkey paid no attention to this\\r\\nspeech because he had just stopped before a house which had painted over\\r\\nthe doorway a pair of hoofs, with a donkey tail between them and a rude\\r\\ncrown and sceptre above.\\n\"I\\'ll see if his magnificent Majesty King Kik-a-bray is at home,\" said\\r\\nhe. He lifted his head and called \"Whee-haw! whee-haw! whee-haw!\" three\\r\\ntimes, in a shocking voice, turning about and kicking with his heels\\r\\nagainst the panel of the door. For a time there was no reply; then the\\r\\ndoor opened far enough to permit a donkey\\'s head to stick out and look\\r\\nat them.\\nIt was a white head, with big, awful ears and round, solemn eyes.\\n\"Have the foxes gone?\" it asked, in a trembling voice.\\n\"They haven\\'t been here, most stupendous Majesty,\" replied the grey one.\\r\\n\"The new arrivals prove to be travelers of distinction.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said the King, in a relieved tone of voice. \"Let them come in.\"\\nHe opened the door wide, and the party marched into a big room, which,\\r\\nDorothy thought, looked quite unlike a king\\'s palace. There were mats of\\r\\nwoven grasses on the floor and the place was clean and neat; but his\\r\\nMajesty had no other furniture at all—perhaps because he didn\\'t need\\r\\nit. He squatted down in the center of the room and a little brown donkey\\r\\nran and brought a big gold crown which it placed on the monarch\\'s head,\\r\\nand a golden staff with a jeweled ball at the end of it, which the King\\r\\nheld between his front hoofs as he sat upright.\\n\"Now, then,\" said his Majesty, waving his long ears gently to and fro,\\r\\n\"tell me why you are here, and what you expect me to do for you.\" He\\r\\neyed Button-Bright rather sharply, as if afraid of the little boy\\'s\\r\\nqueer head, though it was the shaggy man who undertook to reply.\\n\\n\"Most noble and supreme ruler of Dunkiton,\" he said, trying not to laugh\\r\\nin the solemn King\\'s face, \"we are strangers traveling through your\\r\\ndominions, and have entered your magnificent city because the road led\\r\\nthrough it, and there was no way to go around. All we desire is to pay\\r\\nour respects to your Majesty—the cleverest king in all the world, I\\'m\\r\\nsure—and then to continue on our way.\"\\nThis polite speech pleased the King very much; indeed, it pleased him so\\r\\nmuch that it proved an unlucky speech for the shaggy man. Perhaps the\\r\\nLove Magnet helped to win his Majesty\\'s affection as well as the\\r\\nflattery, but however this may be the white donkey looked kindly upon\\r\\nthe speaker and said:\\n\"Only a donkey should be able to use such fine, big words, and you are\\r\\ntoo wise and admirable in all ways to be a mere man. Also I feel that I\\r\\nlove you as well as I do my own favored people, so I will bestow upon\\r\\nyou the greatest gift within my power—a donkey\\'s head.\"\\nAs he spoke he waved his jeweled staff. Although the shaggy man cried\\r\\nout and tried to leap backward and escape, it proved of no use. Suddenly\\r\\nhis own head was gone and a donkey head appeared in its place—a brown,\\r\\nshaggy head so absurd and droll that Dorothy and Polly both broke into\\r\\nmerry laughter, and even Button-Bright\\'s fox face wore a smile.\\n\"Dear me! dear me!\" cried the shaggy man, feeling of his shaggy new head\\r\\nand his long ears. \"What a misfortune—what a great misfortune! Give me\\r\\nback my own head, you stupid king—if you love me at all!\"\\n\"Don\\'t you like it?\" asked the King, surprised.\\n\"Hee-haw! I hate it! Take it away—quick!\" said the shaggy man.\\nKING KICK-A-BRAY WORKS MAGIC ON THE SHAGGY MAN\\n\"But I can\\'t do that,\" was the reply. \\'\"My magic works only one way. I\\r\\ncan do things, but I can\\'t un do them. You\\'ll have to find the Truth\\r\\nPond, and bathe in its water, in order to get back your own head. But\\r\\nI advise you not to do that. This head is much more beautiful than the\\r\\nold one.\"\\n\"That\\'s a matter of taste,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Where is the Truth Pond?\" asked the shaggy man, earnestly.\\n\"Somewhere in the Land of Oz; but just the exact location of it I can\\r\\nnot tell,\" was the answer.\\n\"Don\\'t worry, Shaggy Man,\" said Dorothy, smiling because her friend\\r\\nwagged his new ears so comically. \"If the Truth Pond is in Oz we\\'ll be\\r\\nsure to find it when we get there.\"\\n\"Oh! Are you going to the Land of Oz?\" asked King Kik-a-bray.\\n\"I don\\'t know,\" she replied; \"but we\\'ve been told we are nearer the Land\\r\\nof Oz than to Kansas, and if that\\'s so the quickest way for me to get\\r\\nhome is to find Ozma.\"\\n\"Haw-haw! Do you know the mighty Princess Ozma?\" asked the King, his\\r\\ntone both surprised and eager.\\n\"\\'Course I do; she\\'s my friend,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Then perhaps you\\'ll do me a favor,\" continued the white donkey, much\\r\\nexcited.\\n\"What is it?\" she asked.\\n\"Perhaps you can get me an invitation to Princess Ozma\\'s birthday\\r\\ncelebration, which will be the grandest royal function ever held in\\r\\nFairyland. I\\'d love to go.\"\\n\"Hee-haw! You deserve punishment, rather than reward, for giving me this\\r\\ndreadful head,\" said the shaggy man, sorrowfully.\\n\"I wish you wouldn\\'t say \\'hee-haw\\' so much,\" Polychrome begged him; \"it\\r\\nmakes cold chills run down my back.\"\\n\"But I can\\'t help it, my dear; my donkey head wants to bray\\r\\ncontinually,\" he replied. \"Doesn\\'t your fox head want to yelp every\\r\\nminute?\" he asked Button-Bright.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said the boy, still staring at the shaggy man\\'s ears.\\r\\nThese seemed to interest him greatly, and the sight also made him forget\\r\\nhis own fox head, which was a comfort.\\n\"What do you think, Polly? shall I promise the donkey king an invitation\\r\\nto Ozma\\'s party?\" asked Dorothy of the Rainbow\\'s Daughter, who was\\r\\nflitting about the room like a sunbeam because she could never keep\\r\\nstill.\\n\"Do as you please, dear,\" answered Polychrome. \"He might help to amuse\\r\\nthe guests of the Princess.\"\\n\"Then, if you will give us some supper and a place to sleep to-night,\\r\\nand let us get started on our journey early tomorrow morning,\" said\\r\\nDorothy to the King, \"I\\'ll ask Ozma to invite you—if I happen to get to\\r\\nOz.\"\\n\"Good! Hee-haw! Excellent!\" cried Kik-a-bray, much pleased. \"You shall\\r\\nall have fine suppers and good beds. What food would you prefer, a bran\\r\\nmash or ripe oats in the shell?\"\\n\\n\"Neither one,\" replied Dorothy, promptly.\\n\"Perhaps plain hay, or some sweet juicy grass would suit you better,\"\\r\\nsuggested Kik-a-bray, musingly.\\n\"Is that all you have to eat?\" asked the girl.\\n\"What more do you desire?\"\\n\"Well, you see we\\'re not donkeys,\" she explained, \"and so we\\'re used to\\r\\nother food. The foxes gave us a nice supper in Foxville.\"\\n\"We\\'d like some dewdrops and mist-cakes,\" said Polychrome.\\n\"I\\'d prefer apples and a ham sandwich,\" declared the shaggy man; \"for\\r\\nalthough I\\'ve a donkey head I still have my own particular stomach.\"\\n\"I want pie,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"I think some beefsteak and chocolate layer-cake would taste best,\" said\\r\\nDorothy.\\n\"Hee-haw! I declare!\" exclaimed the King. \"It seems each one of you\\r\\nwants a different food. How queer all living creatures are, except\\r\\ndonkeys!\"\\n\"And donkeys like you are queerest of all,\" laughed Polychrome.\\n\"Well,\" decided the King, \"I suppose my Magic Staff will produce the\\r\\nthings you crave; if you are lacking in good taste it is not my fault.\"\\nWith this he waved his staff with the jeweled ball, and before them\\r\\ninstantly appeared a tea-table, set with linen and pretty dishes, and on\\r\\nthe table were the very things each had wished for. Dorothy\\'s beefsteak\\r\\nwas smoking hot, and the shaggy man\\'s apples were plump and\\r\\nrosy-cheeked. The King had not thought to provide chairs, so they all\\r\\nstood in their places around the table and ate with good appetite, being\\r\\nhungry. The Rainbow\\'s Daughter found three tiny dewdrops on a crystal\\r\\nplate, and Button-Bright had a big slice of apple-pie, which he devoured\\r\\neagerly.\\nAfterward the King called the brown donkey, which was his favorite\\r\\nservant, and bade it lead his guests to the vacant house where they\\r\\nwere to pass the night. It had only one room and no furniture except\\r\\nbeds of clean straw and a few mats of woven grasses; but our travelers\\r\\nwere contented with these simple things because they realized it was the\\r\\nbest the Donkey-King had to offer them. As soon as it was dark they lay\\r\\ndown on the mats and slept comfortably until morning.\\nAt daybreak there was a dreadful noise throughout the city. Every donkey\\r\\nin the place brayed. When he heard this the shaggy man woke up and\\r\\ncalled out \"Hee-haw!\" as loud as he could.\\n\\n\"Stop that!\" said Button-Bright, in a cross voice. Both Dorothy and\\r\\nPolly looked at the shaggy man reproachfully.\\n\"I couldn\\'t help it, my dears,\" he said, as if ashamed of his bray; \"but\\r\\nI\\'ll try not to do it again.\"\\nOf course they forgave him, for as he still had the Love Magnet in his\\r\\npocket they were all obliged to love him as much as ever.\\nThey did not see the King again, but Kik-a-bray remembered them; for a\\r\\ntable appeared again in their room with the same food upon it as on the\\r\\nnight before.\\n\"Don\\'t want pie for breakfus\\',\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"I\\'ll give you some of my beefsteak,\" proposed Dorothy; \"there\\'s plenty\\r\\nfor us all.\"\\nThat suited the boy better, but the shaggy man said he was content with\\r\\nhis apples and sandwiches, although he ended the meal by eating\\r\\nButton-Bright\\'s pie. Polly liked her dewdrops and mist-cakes better than\\r\\nany other food, so they all enjoyed an excellent breakfast. Toto had the\\r\\nscraps left from the beefsteak, and he stood up nicely on his hind legs\\r\\nwhile Dorothy fed them to him.\\nBreakfast ended, they passed through the village to the side opposite\\r\\nthat by which they had entered, the brown servant-donkey guiding them\\r\\nthrough the maze of scattered houses. There was the road again, leading\\r\\nfar away into the unknown country beyond.\\n\"King Kik-a-bray says you must not forget his invitation,\" said the\\r\\nbrown donkey, as they passed through the opening in the wall.\\n\"I shan\\'t,\" promised Dorothy.\\n\\nPerhaps no one ever beheld a more strangely assorted group than the one\\r\\nwhich now walked along the road, through pretty green fields and past\\r\\ngroves of feathery pepper-trees and fragrant mimosa. Polychrome, her\\r\\nbeautiful gauzy robes floating around her like a rainbow cloud, went\\r\\nfirst, dancing back and forth and darting now here to pluck a\\r\\nwild-flower or there to watch a beetle crawl across the path. Toto ran\\r\\nafter her at times, barking joyously the while, only to become sober\\r\\nagain and trot along at Dorothy\\'s heels. The little Kansas girl walked\\r\\nholding Button-Bright\\'s hand clasped in her own, and the wee boy with\\r\\nhis fox head covered by the sailor hat presented an odd appearance.\\r\\nStrangest of all, perhaps, was the shaggy man, with his shaggy donkey\\r\\nhead, who shuffled along in the rear with his hands thrust deep in his\\r\\nbig pockets.\\nNone of the party was really unhappy. All were straying in an unknown\\r\\nland and had suffered more or less annoyance and discomfort; but they\\r\\nrealized they were having a fairy adventure in a fairy country, and were\\r\\nmuch interested in finding out what would happen next.\\n\\n\\nABOUT the middle of the forenoon they began to go up a long hill.\\r\\nBy-and-by this hill suddenly dropped down into a pretty valley, where\\r\\nthe travelers saw to their surprise, a small house standing by the\\r\\nroadside.\\nIt was the first house they had seen, and they hastened into the valley\\r\\nto discover who lived there. No one was in sight as they approached, but\\r\\nwhen they began to get nearer the house they heard queer sounds coming\\r\\nfrom it. They could not make these out at first, but as they became\\r\\nlouder our friends thought they heard a sort of music like that made by\\r\\na wheezy hand-organ; the music fell upon their ears in this way:\\nTiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom!\\nOom, pom-pom! oom, pom-pom!\\nTiddle-tiddle-tiddle, oom pom-pom!\\nOom, pom-pom—pah!\\n\"What is it, a band or a mouth-organ?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Sounds to me like a played-out phonograph,\" said the shaggy man,\\r\\nlifting his enormous ears to listen.\\n\"Oh, there just couldn\\'t be a funnygraf in Fairyland!\" cried Dorothy.\\n\"It\\'s rather pretty, isn\\'t it?\" asked Polychrome, trying to dance to the\\r\\nstrains.\\nTiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,\\nOom pom-pom; oom pom-pom!\\ncame the music to their ears, more distinctly as they drew nearer the\\r\\nhouse. Presently they saw a little fat man sitting on a bench before the\\r\\ndoor. He wore a red, braided jacket that reached to his waist, a blue\\r\\nwaistcoat, and white trousers with gold stripes down the sides. On his\\r\\nbald head was perched a little, round, red cap held in place by a rubber\\r\\nelastic underneath his chin. His face was round, his eyes a faded blue,\\r\\nand he wore white cotton gloves. The man leaned on a stout gold-headed\\r\\ncane, bending forward on his seat to watch his visitors approach.\\n\\nSingularly enough, the musical sounds they had heard seemed to come from\\r\\nthe inside of the fat man himself; for he was playing no instrument nor\\r\\nwas any to be seen near him.\\nThey came up and stood in a row, staring at him, and he stared back\\r\\nwhile the queer sounds came from him as before:\\nTiddle-iddle-iddle, oom pom-pom,\\nOom, pom-pom; oom pom-pom!\\nTiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,\\nOom, pom-pom—pah!\\n\"Why, he\\'s a reg\\'lar musicker!\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"What\\'s a musicker?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Him!\" said the boy.\\nHearing this the fat man sat up a little stiffer than before, as if he\\r\\nhad received a compliment, and still came the sounds:\\nTiddle-widdle-iddle, oom pom-pom,\\nOom pom-pom, oom—— \\n\"Stop it!\" cried the shaggy man, earnestly. \"Stop that dreadful noise!\"\\nThe fat man looked at him sadly and began his reply. When he spoke the\\r\\nmusic changed and the words seemed to accompany the notes. He said—or\\r\\nrather sang:\\nIt isn\\'t a noise that you hear,\\nBut Music, harmonic and clear.\\nMy breath makes me play\\nLike an organ, all day—\\nThat bass note is in my left ear.\\n\"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy; \"he says his breath makes the music.\"\\n\"That\\'s all nonsense,\" declared the shaggy man; but now the music began\\r\\nagain, and they all listened carefully.\\nMy lungs are full of reeds like those\\nIn organs, therefore I suppose,\\nIf I breathe in or out my nose,\\nThe reeds are bound to play.\\nSo, as I breathe to live, you know,\\nI squeeze out music as I go;\\nI\\'m very sorry this is so—— \\nForgive my piping, pray!\\n\\n\\n\"Poor man,\" said Polychrome; \"he can\\'t help it. What a great misfortune\\r\\nit is!\"\\n\"Yes,\" replied the shaggy man; \"we are only obliged to hear this music a\\r\\nshort time, until we leave him and go away; but the poor fellow must\\r\\nlisten to himself as long as he lives, and that is enough to drive him\\r\\ncrazy. Don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright. Toto said \"Bow-wow!\" and the others\\r\\nlaughed.\\n\"Perhaps that\\'s why he lives all alone,\" suggested Dorothy.\\n\"Yes; if he had neighbors they might do him an injury,\" responded the\\r\\nshaggy man.\\nAll this while the little fat musicker was breathing the notes:\\nTiddle-tiddle-iddle, oom, pom-pom,\\nand they had to speak loud in order to hear themselves. The shaggy man\\r\\nsaid:\\n\"Who are you, sir?\"\\nThe reply came in the shape of this sing-song:\\n\\nI\\'m Allegro da Capo, a very famous man;\\nJust find another, high or low, to match me if you can.\\nSome people try, but can\\'t, to play\\nAnd have to practice every day;\\nBut I\\'ve been musical alway, since first my life began.\\n\\n\"Why, I b\\'lieve he\\'s proud of it,\" exclaimed Dorothy, \"and seems to me\\r\\nI\\'ve heard worse music than he makes.\"\\n\"Where?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"I\\'ve forgotten, just now. But Mr. Da Capo is certainly a strange\\r\\nperson—isn\\'t he?—and p\\'r\\'aps he\\'s the only one of his kind in all the\\r\\nworld.\"\\nThis praise seemed to please the little fat musicker, for he swelled out\\r\\nhis chest, looked important and sang as follows:\\n\\nI wear no band around me,\\nAnd yet I am a band!\\nI do not strain to make my strains\\nBut, on the other hand,\\nMy toot is always destitute\\nOf flats or other errors;\\nTo see sharp and be natural are\\nFor me but minor terrors.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t quite understand that,\" said Polychrome, with a puzzled look;\\r\\n\"but perhaps it\\'s because I\\'m accustomed only to the music of the\\r\\nspheres.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"Oh, Polly means the atmosphere and hemisphere, I s\\'pose,\" explained\\r\\nDorothy.\\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Bow-wow!\" said Toto.\\n\\nBut the musicker was still breathing his constant\\nOom, pom-pom; oom, pom-pom—— \\nand it seemed to jar on the shaggy man\\'s nerves.\\n\"Stop it, can\\'t you?\" he cried, angrily; \"or breathe in a whisper; or\\r\\nput a clothes-pin on your nose. Do something, anyhow!\"\\nBut the fat one, with a sad look, sang this answer:\\n\\r\\n\"Music hath charms, and it may\\nSoothe even the savage, they say;\\nSo if savage you feel\\nJust list to my reel,\\nFor sooth to say that\\'s the real way.\"\\n\\nThe shaggy man had to laugh at this, and when he laughed he stretched\\r\\nhis donkey mouth wide open. Said Dorothy:\\n\"I don\\'t know how good his poetry is, but it seems to fit the notes, so\\r\\nthat\\'s all that can be \\'xpected.\"\\n\"I like it,\" said Button-Bright, who was staring hard at the musicker,\\r\\nhis little legs spread wide apart. To the surprise of his companions,\\r\\nthe boy asked this long question:\\n\"If I swallowed a mouth-organ, what would I be?\"\\n\"An organette,\" said the shaggy man. \"But come, my dears; I think the\\r\\nbest thing we can do is to continue on our journey before Button-Bright\\r\\nswallows anything. We must try to find that Land of Oz, you know.\"\\nHearing this speech the musicker sang, quickly:\\nIf you go to the hand of Oz\\nPlease take me along, because\\nOn Ozma\\'s birthday\\nI\\'m anxious to play\\nThe loveliest song ever was.\\n\"No, thank you,\" said Dorothy; \"we prefer to travel alone. But if I see\\r\\nOzma I\\'ll tell her you want to come to her birthday party.\"\\n\"Let\\'s be going,\" urged the shaggy man, anxiously.\\nPolly was already dancing along the road, far in advance, and the\\r\\nothers turned to follow her. Toto did not like the fat musicker and made\\r\\na grab for his chubby leg. Dorothy quickly caught up the growling little\\r\\ndog and hurried after her companions, who were walking faster than usual\\r\\nin order to get out of hearing. They had to climb a hill, and until they\\r\\ngot to the top they could not escape the musicker\\'s monotonous piping:\\n\"Oom, pom-pom; oom, pom-pom;\\nTiddle-iddle-widdle, oom, pom-pom;\\nOom, pom-pom—pah!\"\\nAs they passed the brow of the hill, however, and descended on the other\\r\\nside, the sounds gradually died away, whereat they all felt much\\r\\nrelieved.\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad I don\\'t have to live with the organ-man; aren\\'t you, Polly?\"\\r\\nsaid Dorothy.\\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the Rainbow\\'s Daughter.\\n\"He\\'s nice,\" declared Button-Bright, soberly.\\n\"I hope your Princess Ozma won\\'t invite him to her birthday\\r\\ncelebration,\" remarked the shaggy man; \"for the fellow\\'s music would\\r\\ndrive her guests all crazy. You\\'ve given me an idea, Button-Bright; I\\r\\nbelieve the musicker must have swallowed an accordeon in his youth.\"\\n\"What\\'s \\'cordeon?\" asked the boy.\\n\"It\\'s a kind of pleating,\" explained Dorothy, putting down the dog.\\n\"Bow-wow!\" said Toto, and ran away at a mad gallop to chase a\\r\\nbumble-bee.\\n\\n\\nTHE country wasn\\'t so pretty now. Before the travelers appeared a rocky\\r\\nplain covered with hills on which grew nothing green. They were nearing\\r\\nsome low mountains, too, and the road, which before had been smooth and\\r\\npleasant to walk upon, grew rough and uneven.\\nButton-Bright\\'s little feet stumbled more than once, and Polychrome\\r\\nceased her dancing because the walking was now so difficult that she had\\r\\nno trouble to keep warm.\\nIt had become afternoon, yet there wasn\\'t a thing for their luncheon\\r\\nexcept two apples which the shaggy man had taken from the breakfast\\r\\ntable. He divided these into four pieces and gave a portion to each of\\r\\nhis companions. Dorothy and Button-Bright were glad to get theirs; but\\r\\nPolly was satisfied with a small bite, and Toto did not like apples.\\n\"Do you know,\" asked the Rainbow\\'s Daughter, \"if this is the right road\\r\\nto the Emerald City?\"\\n\"No, I don\\'t,\" replied Dorothy; \"but it\\'s the only road in this part of\\r\\nthe country, so we may as well go to the end of it.\"\\n\"It looks now as if it might end pretty soon,\" remarked the shaggy man;\\r\\n\"and what shall we do if it does?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"If I had my Magic Belt,\" replied Dorothy, thoughtfully, \"it could do us\\r\\na lot of good just now.\"\\n\"What is your Magic Belt?\" asked Polychrome.\\n\"It\\'s a thing I captured from the Nome King one day, and it can do \\'most\\r\\nany wonderful thing. But I left it with Ozma, you know; \\'cause magic\\r\\nwon\\'t work in Kansas, but only in fairy countries.\"\\n\"Is this a fairy country?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"I should think you\\'d know,\" said the little girl, gravely. \"If it\\r\\nwasn\\'t a fairy country you couldn\\'t have a fox head and the shaggy man\\r\\ncouldn\\'t have a donkey head, and the Rainbow\\'s Daughter would be\\r\\ninvis\\'ble.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked the boy.\\n\"You don\\'t seem to know anything, Button-Bright. Invis\\'ble is a thing\\r\\nyou can\\'t see.\"\\n\"Then Toto\\'s invisible,\" declared the boy, and Dorothy found he was\\r\\nright. Toto had disappeared from view, but they could hear him barking\\r\\nfuriously among the heaps of grey rock ahead of them.\\n\\nThey moved forward a little faster to see what the dog was barking at,\\r\\nand found perched upon a point of rock by the roadside a curious\\r\\ncreature. It had the form of a man, middle-sized and rather slender and\\r\\ngraceful; but as it sat silent and motionless upon the peak they could\\r\\nsee that its face was black as ink, and it wore a black cloth costume\\r\\nmade like a union suit and fitting tight to its skin. Its hands were\\r\\nblack, too, and its toes curled down, like a bird\\'s. The creature was\\r\\nblack all over except its hair, which was fine, and yellow, banged in\\r\\nfront across the black forehead and cut close at the sides. The eyes,\\r\\nwhich were fixed steadily upon the barking dog, were small and sparkling\\r\\nand looked like the eyes of a weasel.\\n\"What in the world do you s\\'pose that is?\" asked Dorothy in a hushed\\r\\nvoice, as the little group of travelers stood watching the strange\\r\\ncreature.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\nThe thing gave a jump and turned half around, sitting in the same place\\r\\nbut with the other side of its body facing them. Instead of being black,\\r\\nit was now pure white, with a face like that of a clown in a circus and\\r\\nhair of a brilliant purple. The creature could bend either way, and its\\r\\nwhite toes now curled the same way the black ones on the other side had\\r\\ndone.\\n\"It has a face both front and back,\" whispered Dorothy, wonderingly;\\r\\n\"only there\\'s no back at all, but two fronts.\"\\nHaving made the turn, the being sat motionless as before, while Toto\\r\\nbarked louder at the white man than he had done at the black one.\\n\"Once,\" said the shaggy man, \"I had a jumping-jack like that, with two\\r\\nfaces.\"\\n\"Was it alive?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"No,\" replied the shaggy man; \"it worked on strings, and was made of\\r\\nwood.\"\\n\"Wonder if this works with strings,\" said Dorothy; but Polychrome cried\\r\\n\"Look!\" for another creature just like the first had suddenly appeared\\r\\nsitting on another rock, its black side toward them. The two twisted\\r\\ntheir heads around and showed a black face on the white side of one and\\r\\na white face on the black side of the other.\\n\\n\"How curious,\" said Polychrome; \"and how loose their heads seem to be!\\r\\nAre they friendly to us, do you think?\"\\n\"Can\\'t tell, Polly,\" replied Dorothy. \"Let\\'s ask \\'em.\"\\nThe creatures flopped first one way and then the other, showing black or\\r\\nwhite by turns; and now another joined them, appearing on another rock.\\r\\nOur friends had come to a little hollow in the hills, and the place\\r\\nwhere they now stood was surrounded by jagged peaks of rock, except\\r\\nwhere the road ran through.\\n\"Now there are four of them,\" said the shaggy man.\\n\"Five,\" declared Polychrome.\\n\"Six,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Lots of \\'em!\" cried Button-Bright; and so there were—quite a row of\\r\\nthe two-sided black and white creatures sitting on the rocks all around.\\nToto stopped barking and ran between Dorothy\\'s feet, where he crouched\\r\\ndown as if afraid. The creatures did not look pleasant or friendly, to\\r\\nbe sure, and the shaggy man\\'s donkey face became solemn, indeed.\\n\"Ask \\'em who they are, and what they want,\" whispered Dorothy; so the\\r\\nshaggy man called out in a loud voice:\\n\"Who are you?\"\\n\"Scoodlers!\" they yelled in chorus, their voices sharp and shrill.\\n\"What do you want?\" called the shaggy man.\\n\"You!\" they yelled, pointing their thin fingers at the group; and they\\r\\nall flopped around, so they were white, and then all flopped back again,\\r\\nso they were black.\\n\"But what do you want us for?\" asked the shaggy man, uneasily.\\n\"Soup!\" they all shouted, as if with one voice.\\n\"YOU!\" THEY YELLED\\n\"Goodness me!\" said Dorothy, trembling a little; \"the Scoodlers must be\\r\\nreg\\'lar cannibals.\"\\n\"Don\\'t want to be soup,\" protested Button-Bright, beginning to cry.\\n\"Hush, dear,\" said the little girl, trying to comfort him; \"we don\\'t any\\r\\nof us want to be soup. But don\\'t worry; the shaggy man will take care of\\r\\nus.\"\\n\"Will he?\" asked Polychrome, who did not like the Scoodlers at all, and\\r\\nkept close to Dorothy.\\n\"I\\'ll try,\" promised the shaggy man; but he looked worried.\\nHappening just then to feel the Love Magnet in his pocket, he said to\\r\\nthe creatures, with more confidence:\\n\"Don\\'t you love me?\"\\n\"Yes!\" they shouted, all together.\\n\"Then you mustn\\'t harm me, or my friends,\" said the shaggy man, firmly.\\n\"We love you in soup!\" they yelled, and in a flash turned their white\\r\\nsides to the front.\\n\"How dreadful!\" said Dorothy. \"This is a time, Shaggy Man, when you get\\r\\nloved too much.\"\\n\"Don\\'t want to be soup!\" wailed Button-Bright again; and Toto began to\\r\\nwhine dismally, as if he didn\\'t want to be soup, either.\\n\"The only thing to do,\" said the shaggy man to his friends, in a low\\r\\ntone, \"is to get out of this pocket in the rocks as soon as we can, and\\r\\nleave the Scoodlers behind us. Follow me, my dears, and don\\'t pay any\\r\\nattention to what they do or say.\"\\nWith this he began to march along the road to the opening in the rocks\\r\\nahead, and the others kept close behind him. But the Scoodlers closed up\\r\\nin front, as if to bar their way, and so the shaggy man stooped down and\\r\\npicked up a loose stone, which he threw at the creatures to scare them\\r\\nfrom the path.\\nAt this the Scoodlers raised a howl. Two of them picked their heads from\\r\\ntheir shoulders and hurled them at the shaggy man with such force that\\r\\nhe fell over in a heap, greatly astonished. The two now ran forward with\\r\\nswift leaps, caught up their heads, and put them on again, after which\\r\\nthey sprang back to their positions on the rocks.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE shaggy man got up and felt of himself to see if he was hurt; but he\\r\\nwas not. One of the heads had struck his breast and the other his left\\r\\nshoulder; yet though they had knocked him down the heads were not hard\\r\\nenough to bruise him.\\n\"Come on,\" he said, firmly; \"we\\'ve got to get out of here some way,\" and\\r\\nforward he started again.\\nThe Scoodlers began yelling and throwing their heads in great numbers at\\r\\nour frightened friends. The shaggy man was knocked over again, and so\\r\\nwas Button-Bright, who kicked his heels against the ground and howled as\\r\\nloud as he could, although he was not hurt a bit. One head struck Toto,\\r\\nwho first yelped and then grabbed the head by an ear and started running\\r\\naway with it.\\nThe Scoodlers who had thrown their heads began to scramble down and run\\r\\nto pick them up, with wonderful quickness; but the one whose head Toto\\r\\nhad stolen found it hard to get it back again. The head couldn\\'t see the\\r\\nbody with either pair of its eyes, because the dog was in the way, so\\r\\nthe headless Scoodler stumbled around over the rocks and tripped on them\\r\\nmore than once in its effort to regain its top. Toto was trying to get\\r\\noutside the rocks and roll the head down the hill; but some of the other\\r\\nScoodlers came to the rescue of their unfortunate comrade and pelted the\\r\\ndog with their own heads until he was obliged to drop his burden and\\r\\nhurry back to Dorothy.\\nThe little girl and the Rainbow\\'s Daughter had both escaped the shower\\r\\nof heads, but they saw now that it would be useless to try to run away\\r\\nfrom the dreadful Scoodlers.\\n\"We may as well submit,\" declared the shaggy man, in a rueful voice, as\\r\\nhe got upon his feet again. He turned toward their foes and asked:\\n\"What do you want us to do?\"\\n\"Come!\" they cried, in a triumphant chorus, and at once sprang from the\\r\\nrocks and surrounded their captives on all sides. One funny thing about\\r\\nthe Scoodlers was they could walk in either direction, coming or going,\\r\\nwithout turning around; because they had two faces and, as Dorothy\\r\\nsaid, \"two front sides,\" and their feet were shaped like the letter T\\r\\nupside down\\r\\n(). They moved with great rapidity and\\r\\nthere was something about their glittering eyes and contrasting colors\\r\\nand removable heads that inspired the poor prisoners with horror, and\\r\\nmade them long to escape.\\n\\nBut the creatures led their captives away from the rocks and the road,\\r\\ndown the hill by a side path until they came before a low mountain of\\r\\nrock that looked like a huge bowl turned upside down. At the edge of\\r\\nthis mountain was a deep gulf—so deep that when you looked into it\\r\\nthere was nothing but blackness below. Across the gulf was a narrow\\r\\nbridge of rock, and at the other end of the bridge was an arched opening\\r\\nthat led into the mountain.\\nOver this bridge the Scoodlers led their prisoners, through the opening\\r\\ninto the mountain, which they found to be an immense hollow dome lighted\\r\\nby several holes in the roof. All around the circular space were built\\r\\nrock houses, set close together, each with a door in the front wall.\\r\\nNone of these houses was more than six feet wide, but the Scoodlers were\\r\\nthin people sidewise and did not need much room. So vast was the dome\\r\\nthat there was a large space in the middle of the cave, in front of all\\r\\nthese houses, where the creatures might congregate as in a great hall.\\nIt made Dorothy shudder to see a huge iron kettle suspended by a stout\\r\\nchain in the middle of the place, and underneath the kettle a great heap\\r\\nof kindling wood and shavings, ready to light.\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked the shaggy man, drawing back as they approached\\r\\nthis place, so that they were forced to push him forward.\\n\"The Soup Kettle!\" yelled the Scoodlers; and then they shouted in the\\r\\nnext breath:\\n\"We\\'re hungry!\"\\nButton-Bright, holding Dorothy\\'s hand in one chubby fist and Polly\\'s\\r\\nhand in the other, was so affected by this shout that he began to cry\\r\\nagain, repeating the protest:\\n\"Don\\'t want to be soup, I don\\'t!\"\\n\"Never mind,\" said the shaggy man, consolingly; \"I ought to make enough\\r\\nsoup to feed them all, I\\'m so big; so I\\'ll ask them to put me in the\\r\\nkettle first.\"\\n\"All right,\" said Button-Bright, more cheerfully.\\nBut the Scoodlers were not ready to make soup yet. They led the captives\\r\\ninto a house at the farthest side of the cave—a house somewhat wider\\r\\nthan the others.\\n\"Who lives here?\" asked the Rainbow\\'s Daughter. The Scoodlers nearest\\r\\nher replied:\\n\"The Queen.\"\\nIt made Dorothy hopeful to learn that a woman ruled over these fierce\\r\\ncreatures, but a moment later they were ushered by two or three of the\\r\\nescort into a gloomy, bare room—and her hope died away.\\nFor the Queen of the Scoodlers proved to be much more dreadful in\\r\\nappearance than any of her people. One side of her was fiery red, with\\r\\njet-black hair and green eyes and the other side of her was bright\\r\\nyellow, with crimson hair and black eyes. She wore a short skirt of red\\r\\nand yellow and her hair, instead of being banged, was a tangle of short\\r\\ncurls upon which rested a circular crown of silver—much dented and\\r\\ntwisted because the Queen had thrown her head at so many things so many\\r\\ntimes. Her form was lean and bony and both her faces were deeply\\r\\nwrinkled.\\n\"What have we here?\" asked the Queen, sharply, as our friends were made\\r\\nto stand before her.\\n\"Soup!\" cried the guard of Scoodlers, speaking together.\\n\"We\\'re not!\" said Dorothy, indignantly; \"we\\'re nothing of the sort.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, but you will be soon,\" retorted the Queen, a grim smile making her\\r\\nlook more dreadful than before.\\n\"Pardon me, most beautiful vision,\" said the shaggy man, bowing before\\r\\nthe queen politely. \"I must request your Serene Highness to let us go\\r\\nour way without being made into soup. For I own the Love Magnet, and\\r\\nwhoever meets me must love me and all my friends.\"\\n\"True,\" replied the Queen. \"We love you very much; so much that we\\r\\nintend to eat your broth with real pleasure. But tell me, do you think I\\r\\nam so beautiful?\"\\n\"You won\\'t be at all beautiful if you eat me,\" he said, shaking his head\\r\\nsadly. \"Handsome is as handsome does, you know.\"\\nThe Queen turned to Button-Bright.\\n\"Do you think I\\'m beautiful?\" she asked.\\n\"No,\" said the boy; \"you\\'re ugly.\"\\n\"I think you\\'re a fright,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"If you could see yourself you\\'d be terribly scared,\" added Polly.\\nThe Queen scowled at them and flopped from her red side to her yellow\\r\\nside.\\n\"Take them away,\" she commanded the guard, \"and at six o\\'clock run them\\r\\nthrough the meat chopper and start the soup kettle boiling. And put\\r\\nplenty of salt in the broth this time, or I\\'ll punish the cooks\\r\\nseverely.\"\\n\"Any onions, your Majesty?\" asked one of the guard.\\n\"Plenty of onions and garlic and a dash of red pepper. Now, go!\"\\nThe Scoodlers led the captives away and shut them up in one of the\\r\\nhouses, leaving only a single Scoodler to keep guard.\\nThe place was a sort of store-house; containing bags of potatoes and\\r\\nbaskets of carrots, onions, and turnips.\\n\"These,\" said their guard, pointing to the vegetables, \"we use to flavor\\r\\nour soups with.\"\\nThe prisoners were rather disheartened by this time, for they saw no way\\r\\nto escape and did not know how soon it would be six o\\'clock and time for\\r\\nthe meat-chopper to begin work. But the shaggy man was brave and did not\\r\\nintend to submit to such a horrid fate without a struggle.\\n\"I\\'m going to fight for our lives,\" he whispered to the children, \"for\\r\\nif I fail we will be no worse off than before, and to sit here quietly\\r\\nuntil we are made into soup would be foolish and cowardly.\"\\n\\nThe Scoodler on guard stood near the doorway, turning first his white\\r\\nside toward them and then his black side, as if he wanted to show to all\\r\\nof his greedy four eyes the sight of so many fat prisoners. The captives\\r\\nsat in a sorrowful group at the other end of the room—except\\r\\nPolychrome, who danced back and forth in the little place to keep\\r\\nherself warm, for she felt the chill of the cave. Whenever she\\r\\napproached the shaggy man he would whisper something in her ear, and\\r\\nPolly would nod her pretty head as if she understood.\\nThe shaggy man told Dorothy and Button-Bright to stand before him while\\r\\nhe emptied the potatoes out of one of the sacks. When this had been\\r\\nsecretly done little Polychrome, dancing near to the guard, suddenly\\r\\nreached out her hand and slapped his face, the next instant whirling\\r\\naway from him quickly to rejoin her friends.\\nThe angry Scoodler at once picked off his head and hurled it at the\\r\\nRainbow\\'s Daughter; but the shaggy man was expecting that, and caught\\r\\nthe head very neatly, putting it in the sack, which he tied at the\\r\\nmouth. The body of the guard, not having the eyes of its head to guide\\r\\nit, ran here and there in an aimless manner, and the shaggy man easily\\r\\ndodged it and opened the door. Fortunately there was no one in the big\\r\\ncave at that moment, so he told Dorothy and Polly to run as fast as they\\r\\ncould for the entrance, and out across the narrow bridge.\\nTHE SHAGGY MAN CAUGHT THE HEADS AND TOSSED THEM INTO THE\\r\\nGULF BELOW\\n\"I\\'ll carry Button-Bright,\" he said, for he knew the little boy\\'s legs\\r\\nwere too short to run fast.\\nDorothy picked up Toto, and then seized Polly\\'s hand and ran swiftly\\r\\ntoward the entrance to the cave. The shaggy man perched Button-Bright on\\r\\nhis shoulders and ran after them. They moved so quickly and their escape\\r\\nwas so wholly unexpected that they had almost reached the bridge when\\r\\none of the Scoodlers looked out of his house and saw them.\\nThe creature raised a shrill cry that brought all its fellows bounding\\r\\nout of the numerous doors, and at once they started in chase. Dorothy\\r\\nand Polly had reached the bridge and crossed it when the Scoodlers began\\r\\nthrowing their heads. One of the queer missiles struck the shaggy man on\\r\\nhis back and nearly knocked him over; but he was at the mouth of the\\r\\ncave now, so he set down Button-Bright and told the boy to run across\\r\\nthe bridge to Dorothy.\\nThen the shaggy man turned around and faced his enemies, standing just\\r\\noutside the opening, and as fast as they threw their heads at him he\\r\\ncaught them and tossed them into the black gulf below. The headless\\r\\nbodies of the foremost Scoodlers kept the others from running close up,\\r\\nbut they also threw their heads in an effort to stop the escaping\\r\\nprisoners. The shaggy man caught them all and sent them whirling down\\r\\ninto the black gulf. Among them he noticed the crimson and yellow head\\r\\nof the Queen, and this he tossed after the others with right good will.\\nPresently every Scoodler of the lot had thrown its head, and every head\\r\\nwas down in the deep gulf, and now the helpless bodies of the creatures\\r\\nwere mixed together in the cave and wriggling around in a vain attempt\\r\\nto discover what had become of their heads. The shaggy man laughed and\\r\\nwalked across the bridge to rejoin his companions.\\n\\n\"It\\'s lucky I learned to play base-ball when I was young,\" he remarked,\\r\\n\"for I caught all those heads easily, and never missed one. But come\\r\\nalong, little ones; the Scoodlers will never bother us or anyone else\\r\\nany more.\"\\nButton-Bright was still frightened and kept insisting, \"I don\\'t want to\\r\\nbe soup!\" for the victory had been gained so suddenly that the boy could\\r\\nnot realize they were free and safe. But the shaggy man assured him that\\r\\nall danger of their being made into soup was now past, as the Scoodlers\\r\\nwould be unable to eat soup for some time to come.\\nSo now, anxious to get away from the horrid gloomy cave as soon as\\r\\npossible, they hastened up the hillside and regained the road just\\r\\nbeyond the place where they had first met the Scoodlers; and you may be\\r\\nsure they were glad to find their feet on the old familiar path again.\\n\\n\\n\"IT\\'S getting awful rough walking,\" said Dorothy, as they trudged along.\\r\\nButton-Bright gave a deep sigh and said he was hungry. Indeed, all were\\r\\nhungry, and thirsty, too; for they had eaten nothing but the apples\\r\\nsince breakfast; so their steps lagged and they grew silent and weary.\\r\\nAt last they slowly passed over the crest of a barren hill and saw\\r\\nbefore them a line of green trees with a strip of grass at their feet.\\r\\nAn agreeable fragrance was wafted toward them.\\nOur travelers, hot and tired, ran forward on beholding this refreshing\\r\\nsight and were not long in coming to the trees. Here they found a spring\\r\\nof pure bubbling water, around which the grass was full of wild\\r\\nstrawberry plants, their pretty red berries ripe and ready to eat. Some\\r\\nof the trees bore yellow oranges and some russet pears, so the hungry\\r\\nadventurers suddenly found themselves provided with plenty to eat and to\\r\\ndrink.\\nThey lost no time in picking the biggest strawberries and ripest oranges\\r\\nand soon had feasted to their hearts\\' content. Walking beyond the line\\r\\nof trees they saw before them a fearful, dismal desert, everywhere grey\\r\\nsand. At the edge of this awful waste was a large white sign with black\\r\\nletters neatly painted upon it; and the letters made these words:\\n\\nALL PERSONS ARE WARNED NOT TO\\r\\nVENTURE UPON THIS DESERT\\nFor the Deadly Sands will Turn Any Living Flesh to Dust in an\\r\\nInstant.Beyond This Barrier is the\\nLAND OF OZ\\nBut no one can Reach that Beautiful Country because of these\\r\\nDestroying Sands\\n\\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, when the shaggy man had read this sign aloud; \"I\\'ve\\r\\nseen this desert before, and it\\'s true no one can live who tries to walk\\r\\nupon the sands.\"\\n\"Then we mustn\\'t try it,\" answered the shaggy man, thoughtfully. \"But as\\r\\nwe can\\'t go ahead and there\\'s no use going back, what shall we do\\r\\nnext?\"\\n\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"I\\'m sure I don\\'t know, either,\" added Dorothy, despondently.\\n\"I wish father would come for me,\" sighed the pretty Rainbow\\'s Daughter,\\r\\n\"I would take you all to live upon the rainbow, where you could dance\\r\\nalong its rays from morning till night, without a care or worry of any\\r\\nsort. But I suppose father\\'s too busy just now to search the world for\\r\\nme.\"\\n\"Don\\'t want to dance,\" said Button-Bright, sitting down wearily upon the\\r\\nsoft grass.\\n\"It\\'s very good of you, Polly,\" said Dorothy; \"but there are other\\r\\nthings that would suit me better than dancing on rainbows. I\\'m \\'fraid\\r\\nthey\\'d be kind of soft an\\' squnshy under foot, anyhow, although they\\'re\\r\\nso pretty to look at.\"\\nThis didn\\'t help to solve the problem, and they all fell silent and\\r\\nlooked at one another questioningly.\\n\"Really, I don\\'t know what to do,\" muttered the shaggy man, gazing hard\\r\\nat Toto; and the little dog wagged his tail and said \"Bow-wow!\" just as\\r\\nif he could not tell, either, what to do. Button-Bright got a stick and\\r\\nbegan to dig in the earth, and the others watched him for a while in\\r\\ndeep thought. Finally the shaggy man said:\\n\"It\\'s nearly evening, now; so we may well sleep in this pretty place and\\r\\nget rested; perhaps by morning we can decide what is best to be done.\"\\nThere was little chance to make beds for the children, but the leaves of\\r\\nthe trees grew thickly and would serve to keep off the night dews, so\\r\\nthe shaggy man piled soft grasses in the thickest shade and when it was\\r\\ndark they lay down and slept peacefully until morning.\\nLong after the others were asleep, however, the shaggy man sat in the\\r\\nstarlight by the spring, gazing thoughtfully into its bubbling waters.\\r\\nSuddenly he smiled and nodded to himself as if he had found a good\\r\\nthought, after which he, too, laid himself down under a tree and was\\r\\nsoon lost in slumber.\\n\\nIn the bright morning sunshine, as they ate of the strawberries and\\r\\nsweet juicy pears, Dorothy said:\\n\"Polly, can you do any magic?\"\\n\"No, dear,\" answered Polychrome, shaking her dainty head.\\n\"You ought to know some magic, being the Rainbow\\'s Daughter,\"\\r\\ncontinued Dorothy, earnestly.\\n\"But we who live on the rainbow among the fleecy clouds have no use for\\r\\nmagic,\" replied Polychrome.\\n\"What I\\'d like,\" said Dorothy, \"is to find some way to cross the desert\\r\\nto the Land of Oz and its Emerald City. I\\'ve crossed it already, you\\r\\nknow, more than once. First a cyclone carried my house over, and some\\r\\nSilver Shoes brought me back again—in half a second. Then Ozma took me\\r\\nover on her Magic Carpet, and the Nome King\\'s Magic Belt took me home\\r\\nthat time. You see it was magic that did it every time \\'cept the first,\\r\\nand we can\\'t \\'spect a cyclone to happen along and take us to the Emerald\\r\\nCity now.\"\\n\"No, indeed,\" returned Polly, with a shudder; \"I hate cyclones, anyway.\"\\n\"That\\'s why I wanted to find out if you could do any magic,\" said the\\r\\nlittle Kansas girl. \"I\\'m sure I can\\'t; and I\\'m sure Button-Bright can\\'t;\\r\\nand the only magic the shaggy man has is the Love Magnet, which won\\'t\\r\\nhelp us much.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be too sure of that, my dear,\" spoke the shaggy man, a smile on\\r\\nhis donkey face. \"I may not be able to do magic myself, but I can call\\r\\nto us a powerful friend who loves me because I own the Love Magnet, and\\r\\nthis friend surely will be able to help us.\"\\n\"Who is your friend?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Johnny Dooit.\"\\n\"What can Johnny do?\"\\n\"Anything,\" answered the shaggy man, with confidence.\\n\"Ask him to come,\" she exclaimed, eagerly.\\nThe shaggy man took the Love Magnet from his pocket and unwrapped the\\r\\npaper that surrounded it. Holding the charm in the palm of his hand he\\r\\nlooked at it steadily and said these words:\\n\\n\"Dear Johnny Dooit, come to me.\\nI need you bad as bad can be.\"\\n\\n\"Well, here I am,\" said a cheery little voice; \"but you shouldn\\'t say\\r\\nyou need me bad, \\'cause I\\'m always, always good.\"\\nAt this they quickly whirled around to find a funny little man sitting\\r\\non a big copper chest, puffing smoke from a long pipe. His hair was\\r\\ngrey, his whiskers were grey; and these whiskers were so long that he\\r\\nhad wound the ends of them around his waist and tied them in a hard knot\\r\\nunderneath the leather apron that reached from his chin nearly to his\\r\\nfeet, and which was soiled and scratched as if it had been used a long\\r\\ntime. His nose was broad, and stuck up a little; but his eyes were\\r\\ntwinkling and merry. The little man\\'s hands and arms were as hard and\\r\\ntough as the leather in his apron, and Dorothy thought Johnny Dooit\\r\\nlooked as if he had done a lot of hard work in his lifetime.\\n\\n\"Good morning, Johnny,\" said the shaggy man. \"Thank you for coming to me\\r\\nso quickly.\"\\n\"I never waste time,\" said the newcomer, promptly. \"But what\\'s happened\\r\\nto you? Where did you get that donkey head? Really, I wouldn\\'t have\\r\\nknown you at all, Shaggy Man, if I hadn\\'t looked at your feet.\"\\nThe shaggy man introduced Johnny Dooit to Dorothy and Toto and\\r\\nButton-Bright and the Rainbow\\'s Daughter, and told him the story of\\r\\ntheir adventures, adding that they were anxious now to reach the Emerald\\r\\nCity in the Land of Oz, where Dorothy had friends who would take care of\\r\\nthem and send them safe home again.\\n\"But,\" said he, \"we find that we can\\'t cross this desert, which turns\\r\\nall living flesh that touches it into dust; so I have asked you to come\\r\\nand help us.\"\\nJohnny Dooit puffed his pipe and looked carefully at the dreadful desert\\r\\nin front of them—stretching so far away they could not see its end.\\n\"You must ride,\" he said, briskly.\\n\"What in?\" asked the shaggy man.\\n\"In a sand-boat, which has runners like a sled and sails like a ship.\\r\\nThe wind will blow you swiftly across the desert and the sand cannot\\r\\ntouch your flesh to turn it into dust.\"\\n\"Good!\" cried Dorothy, clapping her hands delightedly. \"That was the way\\r\\nthe Magic Carpet took us across. We didn\\'t have to touch the horrid sand\\r\\nat all.\"\\n\"But where is the sand-boat?\" asked the shaggy man, looking all around\\r\\nhim.\\n\"I\\'ll make you one,\" said Johnny Dooit.\\nAs he spoke he knocked the ashes from his pipe and put it in his pocket.\\r\\nThen he unlocked the copper chest and lifted the lid, and Dorothy saw\\r\\nit was full of shining tools of all sorts and shapes.\\nJohnny Dooit moved quickly now—so quickly that they were astonished at\\r\\nthe work he was able to accomplish. He had in his chest a tool for\\r\\neverything he wanted to do, and these must have been magic tools because\\r\\nthey did their work so fast and so well.\\nThe man hummed a little song as he worked, and Dorothy tried to listen\\r\\nto it. She thought the words were something like these:\\n\\nThe only way to do a thing\\nIs do it when you can,\\nAnd do it cheerfully, and sing\\nAnd work and think and plan.\\nThe only real unhappy one\\nIs he who dares to shirk;\\nThe only really happy one\\nIs he who cares to work.\\n\\nWhatever Johnny Dooit was singing he was certainly doing things, and\\r\\nthey all stood by and watched him in amazement.\\nHe seized an axe and in a couple of chops felled a tree. Next he took a\\r\\nsaw and in a few minutes sawed the tree-trunk into broad long boards. He\\r\\nthen nailed the boards together into the shape of a boat, about twelve\\r\\nfeet long and four feet wide. He cut from another tree a long, slender\\r\\npole which, when trimmed of its branches and fastened upright in the\\r\\ncenter of the boat, served as a mast. From the chest he drew a coil of\\r\\nrope and a big bundle of canvas, and with these—still humming his\\r\\nsong—he rigged up a sail, arranging it so it could be raised or lowered\\r\\nupon the mast.\\nDorothy fairly gasped with wonder to see the thing grow so speedily\\r\\nbefore her eyes, and both Button-Bright and Polly looked on with the\\r\\nsame absorbed interest.\\n\\n\"It ought to be painted,\" said Johnny Dooit, tossing his tools back into\\r\\nthe chest, \"for that would make it look prettier. But \\'though I can\\r\\npaint it for you in three seconds it would take an hour to dry, and\\r\\nthat\\'s a waste of time.\"\\n\"We don\\'t care how it looks,\" said the shaggy man, \"if only it will take\\r\\nus across the desert.\"\\n\"It will do that,\" declared Johnny Dooit. \"All you need worry about is\\r\\ntipping over. Did you ever sail a ship?\"\\n\"I\\'ve seen one sailed,\" said the shaggy man.\\n\"Good. Sail this boat the way you\\'ve seen a ship sailed, and you\\'ll be\\r\\nacross the sands before you know it.\"\\nWith this he slammed down the lid of the chest, and the noise made them\\r\\nall wink. While they were winking the workman disappeared, tools and\\r\\nall.\\n\\n\\n\"OH, that\\'s too bad!\" cried Dorothy; \"I wanted to thank Johnny Dooit for\\r\\nall his kindness to us.\"\\n\"He hasn\\'t time to listen to thanks,\" replied the shaggy man; \"but I\\'m\\r\\nsure he knows we are grateful. I suppose he is already at work in some\\r\\nother part of the world.\"\\nThey now looked more carefully at the sand-boat, and saw that the bottom\\r\\nwas modelled with two sharp runners which would glide through the sand.\\r\\nThe front of the sand-boat was pointed like the bow of a ship, and there\\r\\nwas a rudder at the stern to steer by.\\nIt had been built just at the edge of the desert, so that all its\\r\\nlength lay upon the grey sand except the after part, which still rested\\r\\non the strip of grass.\\n\"Get in, my dears,\" said the shaggy man; \"I\\'m sure I can manage this\\r\\nboat as well as any sailor. All you need do is sit still in your\\r\\nplaces.\"\\n\\nDorothy got in, Toto in her arms, and sat on the bottom of the boat just\\r\\nin front of the mast. Button-Bright sat in front of Dorothy, while Polly\\r\\nleaned over the bow. The shaggy man knelt behind the mast. When all were\\r\\nready he raised the sail half way. The wind caught it. At once the\\r\\nsand-boat started forward—slowly at first, then with added speed. The\\r\\nshaggy man pulled the sail way up, and they flew so fast over the\\r\\nDeadly Desert that every one held fast to the sides of the boat and\\r\\nscarcely dared to breathe.\\nThe sand lay in billows, and was in places very uneven, so that the boat\\r\\nrocked dangerously from side to side; but it never quite tipped over,\\r\\nand the speed was so great that the shaggy man himself became frightened\\r\\nand began to wonder how he could make the ship go slower.\\n\"If we\\'re spilled in this sand, in the middle of the desert,\" Dorothy\\r\\nthought to herself, \"we\\'ll be nothing but dust in a few minutes, and\\r\\nthat will be the end of us.\"\\nBut they were not spilled, and by-and-bye Polychrome, who was clinging\\r\\nto the bow and looking straight ahead, saw a dark line before them and\\r\\nwondered what it was. It grew plainer every second, until she discovered\\r\\nit to be a row of jagged rocks at the end of the desert, while high\\r\\nabove these rocks she could see a tableland of green grass and beautiful\\r\\ntrees.\\n\"Look out!\" she screamed to the shaggy man. \"Go slowly, or we shall\\r\\nsmash into the rocks.\"\\nHe heard her, and tried to pull down the sail; but the wind would not\\r\\nlet go of the broad canvas and the ropes had become tangled.\\nNearer and nearer they drew to the great rocks, and the shaggy man was\\r\\nin despair because he could do nothing to stop the wild rush of the\\r\\nsand-boat.\\n\"LOOK OUT!\" SCREAMED POLYCHROME\\nThey reached the edge of the desert and bumped squarely into the rocks.\\r\\nThere was a crash as Dorothy, Button-Bright, Toto and Polly flew up in\\r\\nthe air in a curve like a skyrocket\\'s, one after another landing high\\r\\nupon the grass, where they rolled and tumbled for a time before they\\r\\ncould stop themselves.\\nThe shaggy man flew after them, head first, and lighted in a heap beside\\r\\nToto, who, being much excited at the time, seized one of the donkey ears\\r\\nbetween his teeth and shook and worried it as hard as he could, growling\\r\\nangrily. The shaggy man made the little dog let go, and sat up to look\\r\\naround him.\\nDorothy was feeling one of her front teeth, which was loosened by\\r\\nknocking against her knee as she fell. Polly was looking sorrowfully at\\r\\na rent in her pretty gauze gown, and Button-Bright\\'s fox head had stuck\\r\\nfast in a gopher hole and he was wiggling his little fat legs\\r\\nfrantically in an effort to get free.\\nOtherwise they were unhurt by the adventure; so the shaggy man stood up\\r\\nand pulled Button-Bright out of the hole and went to the edge of the\\r\\ndesert to look at the sand-boat. It was a mere mass of splinters now,\\r\\ncrushed out of shape against the rocks. The wind had torn away the sail\\r\\nand carried it to the top of a tall tree, where the fragments of it\\r\\nfluttered like a white flag.\\n\"Well,\" he said, cheerfully, \"we\\'re here; but where the here is I don\\'t\\r\\nknow.\"\\n\"It must be some part of the Land of Oz,\" observed Dorothy, coming to\\r\\nhis side.\\n\"Must it?\"\\n\"\\'Course it must. We\\'re across the desert, aren\\'t we? And somewhere in\\r\\nthe middle of Oz is the Emerald City.\"\\n\"To be sure,\" said the shaggy man, nodding. \"Let\\'s go there.\"\\n\"But I don\\'t see any people about, to show us the way,\" she continued.\\n\"Let\\'s hunt for them,\" he suggested. \"There must be people somewhere;\\r\\nbut perhaps they did not expect us, and so are not at hand to give us a\\r\\nwelcome.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTHEY now made a more careful examination of the country around them. All\\r\\nwas fresh and beautiful after the sultriness of the desert, and the\\r\\nsunshine and sweet, crisp air were delightful to the wanderers. Little\\r\\nmounds of yellowish green were away at the right, while on the left\\r\\nwaved a group of tall leafy trees bearing yellow blossoms that looked\\r\\nlike tassels and pompoms. Among the grasses carpeting the ground were\\r\\npretty buttercups and cowslips and marigolds. After looking at these a\\r\\nmoment Dorothy said reflectively:\\n\"We must be in the Country of the Winkies, for the color of that country\\r\\nis yellow, and you will notice that \\'most everything here is yellow that\\r\\nhas any color at all.\"\\n\"But I thought this was the Land of Oz,\" replied the shaggy man, as if\\r\\ngreatly disappointed.\\n\"So it is,\" she declared; \"but there are four parts to the Land of Oz.\\r\\nThe North Country is purple, and it\\'s the Country of the Gillikins. The\\r\\nEast country is blue, and that\\'s the Country of the Munchkins. Down at\\r\\nthe South is the red Country of the Quadlings, and here, in the West,\\r\\nthe yellow Country of the Winkies. This is the part that is ruled by the\\r\\nTin Woodman, you know.\"\\n\"Who\\'s he?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"Why, he\\'s the tin man I told you about. His name is Nick Chopper, and\\r\\nhe has a lovely heart given him by the wonderful Wizard.\"\\n\"Where does he live?\" asked the boy.\\n\"The Wizard? Oh, he lives in the Emerald City, which is just in the\\r\\nmiddle of Oz, where the corners of the four countries meet.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said Button-Bright, puzzled by this explanation.\\n\"We must be some distance from the Emerald City,\" remarked the shaggy\\r\\nman.\\n\"That\\'s true,\" she replied; \"so we\\'d better start on and see if we can\\r\\nfind any of the Winkies. They\\'re nice people,\" she continued, as the\\r\\nlittle party began walking toward the group of trees, \"and I came here\\r\\nonce with my friends the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, and the\\r\\nCowardly Lion, to fight a wicked witch who had made all the Winkies her\\r\\nslaves.\"\\n\\n\"Did you conquer her?\" asked Polly.\\n\"Why, I melted her with a bucket of water, and that was the end of her,\"\\r\\nreplied Dorothy. \"After that the people were free, you know, and they\\r\\nmade Nick Chopper—that\\'s the Tin Woodman—their Emp\\'ror.\"\\n\"What\\'s that?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"Emp\\'ror? Oh, it\\'s something like an alderman, I guess.\"\\n\"Oh,\" said the boy.\\n\"But I thought Princess Ozma ruled Oz,\" said the shaggy man.\\n\"So she does; she rules the Emerald City and all the four countries of\\r\\nOz; but each country has another little ruler, not so big as Ozma. It\\'s\\r\\nlike the officers of an army, you see; the little rulers are all\\r\\ncaptains, and Ozma\\'s the general.\"\\nBy this time they had reached the trees, which stood in a perfect circle\\r\\nand just far enough apart so that their thick branches touched—or\\r\\n\"shook hands,\" as Button-Bright remarked. Under the shade of the trees\\r\\nthey found, in the center of the circle, a crystal pool, its water as\\r\\nstill as glass. It must have been deep, too, for when Polychrome bent\\r\\nover it she gave a little sigh of pleasure.\\n\"Why, it\\'s a mirror!\" she cried; for she could see all her pretty face\\r\\nand fluffy, rainbow-tinted gown reflected in the pool, as natural as\\r\\nlife.\\nDorothy bent over, too, and began to arrange her hair, blown by the\\r\\ndesert wind into straggling tangles. Button-Bright leaned over the edge\\r\\nnext, and then began to cry, for the sight of his fox head frightened\\r\\nthe poor little fellow.\\n\"I guess I won\\'t look,\" remarked the shaggy man, sadly, for he didn\\'t\\r\\nlike his donkey head, either. While Polly and Dorothy tried to comfort\\r\\nButton-Bright, the shaggy man sat down near the edge of the pool, where\\r\\nhis image could not be reflected, and stared at the water thoughtfully.\\r\\nAs he did this he noticed a silver plate fastened to a rock just under\\r\\nthe surface of the water, and on the silver plate was engraved these\\r\\nwords:\\n\\nTHE TRUTH POND\\n\\n\"Ah!\" cried the shaggy man, springing to his feet with eager joy; \"we\\'ve\\r\\nfound it at last.\"\\n\"Found what?\" asked Dorothy, running to him.\\n\"The Truth Pond. Now, at last, I may get rid of this frightful head; for\\r\\nwe were told, you remember, that only the Truth Pond could restore to me\\r\\nmy proper face.\"\\n\"Me, too!\" shouted Button-Bright, trotting up to them.\\n\"Of course,\" said Dorothy. \"It will cure you both of your bad heads, I\\r\\nguess. Isn\\'t it lucky we found it?\"\\n\\n\"It is, indeed,\" replied the shaggy man. \"I hated dreadfully to go to\\r\\nPrincess Ozma looking like this; and she\\'s to have a birthday\\r\\ncelebration, too.\"\\nJust then a splash startled them, for Button-Bright, in his anxiety to\\r\\nsee the pool that would \"cure\" him, had stepped too near the edge and\\r\\ntumbled heels over head into the water. Down he went, out of sight\\r\\nentirely, so that only his sailor hat floated on the top of the Truth\\r\\nPond.\\nHe soon bobbed up, and the shaggy man seized him by his sailor collar\\r\\nand dragged him to the shore, dripping and gasping for breath. They all\\r\\nlooked upon the boy wonderingly, for the fox head with its sharp nose\\r\\nand pointed ears was gone, and in its place appeared the chubby round\\r\\nface and blue eyes and pretty curls that had belonged to Button-Bright\\r\\nbefore King Dox of Foxville transformed him.\\n\"Oh, what a darling!\" cried Polly, and would have hugged the little one\\r\\nhad he not been so wet.\\nTheir joyful exclamations made the child rub the water out of his eyes\\r\\nand look at his friends questioningly.\\n\"You\\'re all right now, dear,\" said Dorothy. \"Come and look at yourself.\"\\r\\nShe led him to the pool, and although there were still a few ripples on\\r\\nthe surface of the water he could see his reflection plainly.\\n\"It\\'s me!\" he said, in a pleased yet awed whisper.\\nTHE\\r\\nSHAGGY MAN\\'S OWN HEAD RESTORED\\n\"\\'Course it is,\" replied the girl; \"and we\\'re all as glad as you are,\\r\\nButton-Bright.\"\\n\"Well,\" announced the shaggy man, \"it\\'s my turn next.\" He took off his\\r\\nshaggy coat and laid it on the grass and dived head first into the Truth\\r\\nPond.\\n\\nWhen he came up the donkey head had disappeared, and the shaggy man\\'s\\r\\nown shaggy head was in its place, with the water dripping in little\\r\\nstreams from his shaggy whiskers. He scrambled ashore and shook himself\\r\\nto get off some of the wet, and then leaned over the pool to look\\r\\nadmiringly at his reflected face.\\n\"I may not be strictly beautiful, even now,\" he said to his companions,\\r\\nwho watched him with smiling faces; \"but I\\'m so much handsomer than any\\r\\ndonkey that I feel as proud as I can be.\"\\n\"You\\'re all right, Shaggy Man,\" declared Dorothy. \"And Button-Bright is\\r\\nall right, too. So let\\'s thank the Truth Pond for being so nice, and\\r\\nstart on our journey to the Emerald City.\"\\n\"I hate to leave it,\" murmured the shaggy man, with a sigh. \"A truth\\r\\npond wouldn\\'t be a bad thing to carry around with us.\" But he put on his\\r\\ncoat and started with the others in search of some one to direct them on\\r\\ntheir way.\\n\\n\\nTHEY had not walked far across the flower-strewn meadows when they came\\r\\nupon a fine road leading toward the northwest and winding gracefully\\r\\namong the pretty yellow hills.\\n\"That way,\" said Dorothy, \"must be the direction of the Emerald City.\\r\\nWe\\'d better follow the road until we meet some one or come to a house.\"\\nThe sun soon dried Button-Bright\\'s sailor suit and the shaggy man\\'s\\r\\nshaggy clothes, and so pleased were they at regaining their own heads\\r\\nthat they did not mind at all the brief discomfort of getting wet.\\n\"It\\'s good to be able to whistle again,\" remarked the shaggy man, \"for\\r\\nthose donkey lips were so thick I could not whistle a note with them.\"\\r\\nHe warbled a tune as merrily as any bird.\\n\"You\\'ll look more natural at the birthday celebration, too,\" said\\r\\nDorothy, happy in seeing her friends so happy.\\nPolychrome was dancing ahead in her usual sprightly manner, whirling\\r\\ngaily along the smooth, level road, until she passed from sight around\\r\\nthe curve of one of the mounds. Suddenly they heard her exclaim \"Oh!\"\\r\\nand she appeared again, running toward them at full speed.\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Polly?\" asked Dorothy, perplexed.\\nThere was no need for the Rainbow\\'s Daughter to answer, for turning the\\r\\nbend in the road there came advancing slowly toward them a funny round\\r\\nman made of burnished copper, gleaming brightly in the sun. Perched on\\r\\nthe copper man\\'s shoulder sat a yellow hen, with fluffy feathers and a\\r\\npearl necklace around her throat.\\n\"Oh, Tik-tok!\" cried Dorothy, running forward. When she came to him the\\r\\ncopper man lifted the little girl in his copper arms and kissed her\\r\\ncheek with his copper lips.\\n\"Oh, Billina!\" cried Dorothy, in a glad voice, and the yellow hen flew\\r\\nto her arms, to be hugged and petted by turns.\\nThe others were curiously crowding around the group, and the girl said\\r\\nto them:\\n\"It\\'s Tik-tok and Billina; and oh! I\\'m so glad to see them again.\"\\n\"Wel-come to Oz,\" said the copper man, in a monotonous voice.\\n\\nDorothy sat right down in the road, the yellow hen in her arms, and\\r\\nbegan to stroke Billina\\'s back. Said the hen:\\n\"Dorothy, dear, I\\'ve some wonderful news to tell you.\"\\n\"Tell it quick, Billina!\" said the girl.\\nJust then Toto, who had been growling to himself in a cross way gave a\\r\\nsharp bark and flew at the yellow hen, who ruffled her feathers and let\\r\\nout such an angry screech that Dorothy was startled.\\n\"Stop, Toto! Stop that this minute!\" she commanded. \"Can\\'t you see that\\r\\nBillina is my friend?\" In spite of this warning had she not grabbed\\r\\nToto quickly by the neck the little dog would have done the yellow hen a\\r\\nmischief, and even now he struggled madly to escape Dorothy\\'s grasp. She\\r\\nslapped his cars once or twice and told him to behave, and the yellow\\r\\nhen flew to Tik-tok\\'s shoulder again, where she was safe.\\n\"What a brute!\" croaked Billina, glaring down at the little dog.\\n\"Toto isn\\'t a brute,\" replied Dorothy; \"but at home Uncle Henry has to\\r\\nwhip him sometimes for chasing the chickens. Now, look here, Toto,\" she\\r\\nadded, holding up her finger and speaking sternly to him, \"you\\'ve got to\\r\\nunderstand that Billina is one of my dearest friends, and mustn\\'t be\\r\\nhurt—now or ever.\"\\nToto wagged his tail as if he understood.\\n\"The miserable thing can\\'t talk,\" said Billina, with a sneer.\\n\"Yes, he can,\" replied Dorothy; \"he talks with his tail, and I know\\r\\neverything he says. If you could wag your tail, Billina, you wouldn\\'t\\r\\nneed words to talk with.\"\\n\"Nonsense!\" said Billina.\\n\"It isn\\'t nonsense at all. Just now Toto says he\\'s sorry, and that he\\'ll\\r\\ntry to love you for my sake. Don\\'t you, Toto?\"\\n\"Bow-wow!\" said Toto, wagging his tail again.\\n\"But I\\'ve such wonderful news for you; Dorothy,\" cried the yellow hen;\\r\\n\"I\\'ve——\"\\n\"Wait a minute, dear,\" interrupted the little girl; \"I\\'ve got to\\r\\nintroduce you all, first. That\\'s manners, Billina. This,\" turning to her\\r\\ntraveling companions, \"is Mr. Tik-tok, who works by machinery, \\'cause\\r\\nhis thoughts wind up, and his talk winds up, and his action winds\\r\\nup—like a clock.\"\\n\"Do they all wind up together?\" asked the shaggy man.\\n\"No; each one separate. But he works just lovely, and Tik-tok was a good\\r\\nfriend to me once, and saved my life—and Billina\\'s life, too.\"\\n\"Is he alive?\" asked Button-Bright, looking hard at the copper man.\\n\"Oh, no, but his machinery makes him just as good as alive.\" She turned\\r\\nto the copper man and said politely: \"Mr. Tik-tok, these are my new\\r\\nfriends: the shaggy man, and Polly the Rainbow\\'s Daughter, and\\r\\nButton-Bright, and Toto. Only Toto isn\\'t a new friend, \\'cause he\\'s been\\r\\nto Oz before.\"\\nThe copper man bowed low, removing his copper hat as he did so.\\n\"I\\'m ve-ry pleased to meet Dor-o-thy\\'s fr-r-r-r-r——\"\\nHere he stopped short.\\n\"Oh, I guess his speech needs winding!\" said the little girl, running\\r\\nbehind the copper man to get the key off a hook at his back. She wound\\r\\nhim up at a place under his right arm and he went on to say:\\n\"Par-don me for run-ning down. I was a-bout to say I am pleased to meet\\r\\nDor-o-thy\\'s friends, who must be my friends.\" The words were somewhat\\r\\njerky, but plain to understand.\\n\"And this is Billina,\" continued Dorothy, introducing the yellow hen,\\r\\nand they all bowed to her in turn.\\n\"I\\'ve such wonderful news,\" said the hen, turning her head so that one\\r\\nbright eye looked full at Dorothy.\\n\"What is it, dear?\" asked the girl.\\n\"I\\'ve hatched out ten of the loveliest chicks you ever saw.\"\\n\"Oh, how nice! And where are they, Billina?\"\\n\"I left them at home. But they\\'re beauties, I assure you, and all\\r\\nwonderfully clever. I\\'ve named them Dorothy.\"\\n\"Which one?\" asked the girl.\\n\"All of them,\" replied Billina.\\n\"That\\'s funny. Why did you name them all with the same name?\"\\n\"It was so hard to tell them apart,\" explained the hen. \"Now, when I\\r\\ncall \\'Dorothy,\\' they all come running to me in a bunch; it\\'s much\\r\\neasier, after all, than having a separate name for each.\"\\n\"I\\'m just dying to see \\'em, Billina,\" said Dorothy, eagerly. \"But tell\\r\\nme, my friends, how did you happen to be here, in the Country of the\\r\\nWinkies, the first of all to meet us?\"\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,\" answered Tik-tok, in his monotonous voice, all the\\r\\nsounds of his words being on one level—\"Prin-cess Oz-ma saw you in her\\r\\nmag-ic pic-ture, and knew you were com-ing here; so she sent Bil-lin-a\\r\\nand me to wel-come you, as she could not come her-self; so\\r\\nthat—fiz-i-dig-le cum-so-lut-ing hy-ber-gobble in-tu-zib-ick——\"\\n\"Good gracious! Whatever\\'s the matter now?\" cried Dorothy, as the copper\\r\\nman continued to babble these unmeaning words, which no one could\\r\\nunderstand at all because they had no sense.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright, who was half scared. Polly whirled\\r\\naway to a distance and turned to look at the copper man in a fright.\\n\\n\"His thoughts have run down, this time,\" remarked Billina composedly, as\\r\\nshe sat on Tik-tok\\'s shoulder and pruned her sleek feathers. \"When he\\r\\ncan\\'t think he can\\'t talk properly, any more than you can. You\\'ll have\\r\\nto wind up his thoughts, Dorothy, or else I\\'ll have to finish his story\\r\\nmyself.\"\\nDorothy ran around and got the key again and wound up Tik-tok under his\\r\\nleft arm, after which he could speak plainly again.\\n\"Par-don me,\" he said, \"but when my thoughts run down my speech has no\\r\\nmean-ing, for words are formed on-ly by thought. I was a-bout to say\\r\\nthat Oz-ma sent us to wel-come you and in-vite you to come straight to\\r\\nthe Em-er-ald Ci-ty. She was too bus-y to come her-self, for she is\\r\\npre-par-ing for her birth-day cel-e-bra-tion, which is to be a grand\\r\\naf-fair.\"\\n\"I\\'ve heard of it,\" said Dorothy, \"and I\\'m glad we\\'ve come in time to\\r\\nattend. Is it far from here to the Emerald City?\"\\n\"Not ve-ry far,\" answered Tik-tok, \"and we have plen-ty of time.\\r\\nTo-night we will stop at the pal-ace of the Tin Wood-man, and to-mor-row\\r\\nnight we will ar-rive at the Em-er-ald Ci-ty.\"\\n\"Goody!\" cried Dorothy. \"I\\'d like to see dear Nick Chopper again. How\\'s\\r\\nhis heart?\"\\n\"It\\'s fine,\" said Billina; \"the Tin Woodman says it gets softer and\\r\\nkindlier every day. He\\'s waiting at his castle to welcome you, Dorothy;\\r\\nbut he couldn\\'t come with us because he \\'is getting polished as bright\\r\\nas possible for Ozma\\'s party.\"\\n\"Well, then,\" said Dorothy, \"let\\'s start on, and we can talk more as we\\r\\ngo.\"\\nThey proceeded on their journey in a friendly group, for Polychrome had\\r\\ndiscovered that the copper man was harmless and was no longer afraid of\\r\\nhim. Button-Bright was also reassured, and took quite a fancy to\\r\\nTik-tok. He wanted the clockwork man to open himself, so that he might\\r\\nsee the wheels go round; but that was a thing Tik-tok could not do.\\r\\nButton-Bright then wanted to wind up the copper man, and Dorothy\\r\\npromised he should do so as soon as any part of the machinery ran down.\\r\\nThis pleased Button-Bright, who held fast to one of Tik-tok\\'s copper\\r\\nhands as he trudged along the road, while Dorothy walked on the other\\r\\nside of her old friend and Billina perched by turns upon his shoulder or\\r\\nhis copper hat. Polly once more joyously danced ahead and Toto ran after\\r\\nher, barking with glee. The shaggy man was left to walk behind; but he\\r\\ndidn\\'t seem to mind that a bit, and whistled merrily or looked curiously\\r\\nupon the pretty scenes they passed.\\nAt last they came to a hilltop from which the tin castle of Nick Chopper\\r\\ncould plainly be seen, its towers glistening magnificently under the\\r\\nrays of the declining sun.\\n\"How pretty!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I\\'ve never seen the Emp\\'ror\\'s new\\r\\nhouse before.\"\\n\"He built it because the old castle was damp, and likely to rust his tin\\r\\nbody,\" said Billina. \"All those towers and steeples and domes and gables\\r\\ntook a lot of tin, as you can see.\"\\n\"Is it a toy?\" asked Button-Bright, softly.\\n\"No, dear,\" answered Dorothy; \"it\\'s better than that. It\\'s the fairy\\r\\ndwelling of a fairy prince.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE grounds around Nick Chopper\\'s new house were laid out in pretty\\r\\nflower-beds, with fountains of crystal water and statues of tin\\r\\nrepresenting the Emperor\\'s personal friends. Dorothy was astonished and\\r\\ndelighted to find a tin statue of herself standing on a tin pedestal at\\r\\na bend in the avenue leading up to the entrance. It was life-size and\\r\\nshowed her in her sunbonnet with her basket on her arm, just as she had\\r\\nfirst appeared in the Land of Oz.\\n\"Oh, Toto—you\\'re there too!\" she exclaimed; and sure enough there was\\r\\nthe tin figure of Toto lying at the tin Dorothy\\'s feet.\\nAlso Dorothy saw figures of the Scarecrow, and the Wizard, and Ozma, and\\r\\nof many others, including Tik-tok. They reached the grand tin entrance\\r\\nto the tin castle, and the Tin Woodman himself came running out of the\\r\\ndoor to embrace little Dorothy and give her a glad welcome. He welcomed\\r\\nher friends as well, and the Rainbow\\'s Daughter he declared to be the\\r\\nloveliest vision his tin eyes had ever beheld. He patted Button-Bright\\'s\\r\\ncurly head tenderly, for he was fond of children, and turned to the\\r\\nshaggy man and shook both his hands at the same time.\\n\\nNick Chopper, the Emperor of the Winkies, who was also known throughout\\r\\nthe Land of Oz as the Tin Woodman, was certainly a remarkable person. He\\r\\nwas neatly made, all of tin, nicely soldered at the joints, and his\\r\\nvarious limbs were cleverly hinged to his body so that he could use them\\r\\nnearly as well as if they had been common flesh. Once, he told the\\r\\nshaggy man, he had been made all of flesh and bones, as others people\\r\\nare, and then he chopped wood in the forests to earn his living. But the\\r\\naxe slipped so often and cut off parts of him—which he had replaced\\r\\nwith tin—that finally there was no flesh left, nothing but tin; so he\\r\\nbecame a real tin woodman. The wonderful Wizard of Oz had given him an\\r\\nexcellent heart to replace his old one, and he didn\\'t at all mind being\\r\\ntin. Every one loved him, he loved every one; and he was therefore as\\r\\nhappy as the day was long.\\nThe Emperor was proud of his new tin castle, and showed his visitors\\r\\nthrough all the rooms. Every bit of the furniture was made of brightly\\r\\npolished tin—the tables, chairs, beds, and all—even the floors and\\r\\nwalls were of tin.\\n\"I suppose,\" said he, \"that there are no cleverer tinsmiths in all the\\r\\nworld than the Winkies. It would be hard to match this castle in Kansas;\\r\\nwouldn\\'t it, little Dorothy?\"\\n\"Very hard,\" replied the child, gravely.\\n\"It must have cost a lot of money,\" remarked the shaggy man.\\n\"Money! Money in Oz!\" cried the Tin Woodman. \"What a queer idea! Did you\\r\\nsuppose we are so vulgar as to use money here?\"\\n\"Why not?\" asked the shaggy man.\\n\"If we used money to buy things with, instead of love and kindness and\\r\\nthe desire to please one another, then we should be no better than the\\r\\nrest of the world,\" declared the Tin Woodman. \"Fortunately money is not\\r\\nknown in the Land of Oz at all. We have no rich, and no poor; for what\\r\\none wishes the others all try to give him, in order to make him happy,\\r\\nand no one in all Oz cares to have more than he can use.\"\\n\"Good!\" cried the shaggy man, greatly pleased to hear this. \"I also\\r\\ndespise money—a man in Butterfield owes me fifteen cents, and I will\\r\\nnot take it from him. The Land of Oz is surely the most favored land in\\r\\nall the world, and its people the happiest. I should like to live here\\r\\nalways.\"\\nThe Tin Woodman listened with respectful attention. Already he loved the\\r\\nshaggy man, although he did not yet know of the Love Magnet. So he said:\\n\"If you can prove to the Princess Ozma that you are honest and true and\\r\\nworthy of our friendship, you may indeed live here all your days, and be\\r\\nas happy as we are.\"\\n\"I\\'ll try to prove that,\" said the shaggy man, earnestly.\\n\"And now,\" continued the Emperor, \"you must all go to your rooms and\\r\\nprepare for dinner, which will presently be served in the grand tin\\r\\ndining-hall. I am sorry, Shaggy Man, that I can not offer you a change\\r\\nof clothing; but I dress only in tin, myself, and I suppose that would\\r\\nnot suit you.\"\\n\"I care little about dress,\" said the shaggy man, indifferently.\\n\"So I should imagine,\" replied the Emperor, with true politeness.\\nThey were shown to their rooms and permitted to make such toilets as\\r\\nthey could, and soon they assembled again in the grand tin dining-hall,\\r\\neven Toto being present. For the Emperor was fond of Dorothy\\'s little\\r\\ndog, and the girl explained to her friends that in Oz all animals were\\r\\ntreated with as much consideration as the people—\"if they behave\\r\\nthemselves,\" she added.\\nToto behaved himself, and sat in a tin high-chair beside Dorothy and ate\\r\\nhis dinner from a tin platter.\\nIndeed, they all ate from tin dishes, but these were of pretty shapes\\r\\nand brightly polished; Dorothy thought they were just as good as silver.\\nButton-Bright looked curiously at the man who had \"no appetite inside\\r\\nhim,\" for the Tin Woodman, although he had prepared so fine a feast for\\r\\nhis guests, ate not a mouthful himself, sitting patiently in his place\\r\\nto see that all built so they could eat were well and plentifully\\r\\nserved.\\nPOLYCHROME DANCED GRACEFULLY TO THE MUSIC\\nWhat pleased Button-Bright most about the dinner was the tin orchestra\\r\\nthat played sweet music while the company ate. The players were not\\r\\ntin, being just ordinary Winkies; but the instruments they played upon\\r\\nwere all tin—tin trumpets, tin fiddles, tin drums and cymbals and\\r\\nflutes and horns and all. They played so nicely the \"Shining Emperor\\r\\nWaltz,\" composed expressly in honor of the Tin Woodman by Mr. H. M.\\r\\nWogglebug, T. E., that Polly could not resist dancing to it. After she\\r\\nhad tasted a few dewdrops, freshly gathered for her, she danced\\r\\ngracefully to the music while the others finished their repast; and when\\r\\nshe whirled until her fleecy draperies of rainbow hues enveloped her\\r\\nlike a cloud, the Tin Woodman was so delighted that he clapped his tin\\r\\nhands until the noise of them drowned the sound of the cymbals.\\nAltogether it was a merry meal, although Polychrome ate little and the\\r\\nhost nothing at all.\\n\"I\\'m sorry the Rainbow\\'s Daughter missed her mist-cakes,\" said the Tin\\r\\nWoodman to Dorothy; \"but by a mistake Miss Polly\\'s mist-cakes were\\r\\nmislaid and not missed until now. I\\'ll try to have some for her\\r\\nbreakfast.\"\\nThey spent the evening telling stories, and the next morning left the\\r\\nsplendid tin castle and set out upon the road to the Emerald City. The\\r\\nTin Woodman went with them, of course, having by this time been so\\r\\nbrightly polished that he sparkled like silver. His axe, which he always\\r\\ncarried with him, had a steel blade that was tin plated and a handle\\r\\ncovered with tin plate beautifully engraved and set with diamonds.\\nThe Winkies assembled before the castle gates and cheered their Emperor\\r\\nas he marched away, and it was easy to see that they all loved him\\r\\ndearly.\\n\\n\\nDorothy let Button-Bright wind up the clock-work in the copper man this\\r\\nmorning—his thinking machine first, then his speech, and finally his\\r\\naction; so he would doubtless run perfectly until they had reached the\\r\\nEmerald City. The copper man and the tin man were good friends, and not\\r\\nso much alike as you might think. For one was alive and the other moved\\r\\nby means of machinery; one was tall and angular and the other short and\\r\\nround. You could love the Tin Woodman because he had a fine nature,\\r\\nkindly and simple; but the machine man you could only admire without\\r\\nloving, since to love such a thing as he was as impossible as to love a\\r\\nsewing-machine or an automobile. Yet Tik-tok was popular with the people\\r\\nof Oz because he was so trustworthy, reliable and true; he was sure to\\r\\ndo exactly what he was wound up to do, at all times and in all\\r\\ncircumstances. Perhaps it is better to be a machine that does its duty\\r\\nthan a flesh-and-blood person who will not, for a dead truth is better\\r\\nthan a live falsehood.\\nAbout noon the travelers reached a large field of pumpkins—a vegetable\\r\\nquite appropriate to the yellow country of the Winkies—and some of the\\r\\npumpkins which grew there were of remarkable size. Just before they\\r\\nentered upon this field they saw three little mounds that looked like\\r\\ngraves, with a pretty headstone to each one of them.\\n\\n\"What is this?\" asked Dorothy, in wonder.\\n\"It\\'s Jack Pumpkinhead\\'s private graveyard,\" replied the Tin Woodman.\\n\"But I thought nobody ever died in Oz,\" she said.\\n\"Nor do they; although if one is bad, he may be condemned and killed by\\r\\nthe good citizens,\" he answered.\\nDorothy ran over to the little graves and read the words engraved upon\\r\\nthe tombstones. The first one said:\\n\\nHere Lies the Mortal Part of\\nJACK PUMPKINHEADWhich Spoiled April 9th.\\nShe then went to the next stone, which read:\\n\\nHere Lies the Mortal Part of\\nJACK PUMPKINHEADWhich Spoiled October 2nd.\\nOn the third stone were carved these words:\\n\\nHere Lies the Mortal Part of\\nJACK PUMPKINHEADWhich Spoiled January 24th.\\n\"Poor Jack!\" sighed Dorothy. \"I\\'m sorry he had to die in three parts,\\r\\nfor I hoped to see him again.\"\\n\"So you shall,\" declared the Tin Woodman, \"since he is still alive. Come\\r\\nwith me to his house, for Jack is now a farmer and lives in this very\\r\\npumpkin field.\"\\nThey walked over to a monstrous big, hollow pumpkin which had a door and\\r\\nwindows cut through the rind. There was a stovepipe running through the\\r\\nstem, and six steps had been built leading up to the front door.\\nThey walked up to this door and looked in. Seated on a bench was a man\\r\\nclothed in a spotted shirt, a red vest, and faded blue trousers, whose\\r\\nbody was merely sticks of wood, jointed clumsily together. On his neck\\r\\nwas set a round, yellow pumpkin, with a face carved on it such as a boy\\r\\noften carves on a jack-lantern.\\nThis queer man was engaged in snapping slippery pumpkin-seeds with his\\r\\nwooden fingers, trying to hit a target on the other side of the room\\r\\nwith them. He did not know he had visitors until Dorothy exclaimed:\\n\"Why, it\\'s Jack Pumpkinhead himself!\"\\nHe turned and saw them, and at once came forward to greet the little\\r\\nKansas girl and Nick Chopper, and to be introduced to their new friends.\\nButton-Bright was at first rather shy with the quaint Pumpkinhead, but\\r\\nJack\\'s face was so jolly and smiling—being carved that way—that the\\r\\nboy soon grew to like him.\\n\"I thought, a while ago, that you were buried in three parts,\" said\\r\\nDorothy; \"but now I see you\\'re just the same as ever.\"\\n\"Not quite the same, my dear, for my mouth is a little more one-sided\\r\\nthan it used to be; but pretty nearly the same. I\\'ve a new head, and\\r\\nthis is the fourth one I\\'ve owned since Ozma first made me and brought\\r\\nme to life by sprinkling me with the Magic Powder.\"\\n\"What became of the other heads, Jack?\"\\n\"They spoiled and I buried them, for they were not even fit for pies.\\r\\nEach time Ozma has carved me a new head just like the old one, and as my\\r\\nbody is by far the largest part of me I am still Jack Pumpkinhead, no\\r\\nmatter how often I change my upper end. Once we had a dreadful time to\\r\\nfind another pumpkin, as they were out of season, and so I was obliged\\r\\nto wear my old head a little longer than was strictly healthy. But after\\r\\nthis sad experience I resolved to raise pumpkins myself, so as never to\\r\\nbe caught again without one handy; and now I have this fine field that\\r\\nyou see before you. Some grow pretty big—too big to be used for\\r\\nheads—so I dug out this one and use it for a house.\"\\n\"Isn\\'t it damp?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Not very. There isn\\'t much left but the shell, you see, and it will\\r\\nlast a long time yet.\"\\n\"I think you are brighter than you used to be, Jack,\" said the Tin\\r\\nWoodman. \"Your last head was a stupid one.\"\\n\"The seeds in this one are better,\" was the reply.\\n\"Are you going to Ozma\\'s party?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\"Yes,\" said he; \"I wouldn\\'t miss it for anything. Ozma\\'s my parent, you\\r\\nknow, because she built my body and carved my pumpkin head. I\\'ll follow\\r\\nyou to the Emerald City to-morrow, where we shall meet again. I can\\'t go\\r\\nto-day, because I have to plant fresh pumpkin-seeds and water the young\\r\\nvines. But give my love to Ozma, and tell her I\\'ll be there in time for\\r\\nthe jubilation.\"\\n\"We will,\" she promised; and then they all left him and resumed their\\r\\njourney.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE neat yellow houses of the Winkies were now to be seen standing here\\r\\nand there along the roadway, giving the country a more cheerful and\\r\\ncivilized look. They were farm-houses, though, and set far apart; for in\\r\\nthe Land of Oz there were no towns or villages except the magnificent\\r\\nEmerald City in its center.\\nHedges of evergreen or of yellow roses bordered the broad highway and\\r\\nthe farms showed the care of their industrious inhabitants. The nearer\\r\\nthe travelers came to the great city the more prosperous the country\\r\\nbecame, and they crossed many bridges over the sparkling streams and\\r\\nrivulets that watered the lands.\\nAs they walked leisurely along the shaggy man said to the Tin Woodman:\\n\"What sort of a Magic Powder was it, that made your friend the\\r\\nPumpkinhead live?\"\\n\"It was called the Powder of Life,\" was the answer; \"and it was invented\\r\\nby a crooked Sorcerer who lived in the mountains of the North Country. A\\r\\nWitch named Mombi got some of this powder from the crooked Sorcerer and\\r\\ntook it home with her. Ozma lived with the Witch then, for it was before\\r\\nshe became our Princess, while Mombi had transformed her into the shape\\r\\nof a boy. Well, while Mombi was gone to the crooked Sorcerer\\'s, the boy\\r\\nmade this pumpkin-headed man to amuse himself, and also with the hope of\\r\\nfrightening the Witch with it when she returned. But Mombi was not\\r\\nscared, and she sprinkled the Pumpkinhead with her Magic Powder of Life,\\r\\nto see if the Powder would work. Ozma was watching, and saw the\\r\\nPumpkinhead come to life; so that night she took the pepper-box\\r\\ncontaining the Powder and ran away with it and with Jack, in search of\\r\\nadventures.\"\\n\"Next day they found a wooden Saw-Horse standing by the roadside, and\\r\\nsprinkled it with the Powder. It came to life at once, and Jack\\r\\nPumpkinhead rode the Saw-Horse to the Emerald City.\"\\n\"What became of the Saw-Horse, afterward?\" asked the shaggy man, much\\r\\ninterested in this story.\\n\\n\"Oh, it\\'s alive yet, and you will probably meet it presently in the\\r\\nEmerald City. Afterward Ozma used the last of the Powder to bring the\\r\\nFlying Gump to life; but as soon as it had carried her away from her\\r\\nenemies the Gump was taken apart, so it doesn\\'t exist any more.\"\\n\"It\\'s too bad the Powder of Life was all used up,\" remarked the shaggy\\r\\nman; \"it would be a handy thing to have around.\"\\n\"I am not so sure of that, sir,\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"A while ago\\r\\nthe crooked Sorcerer who invented the magic Powder fell down a precipice\\r\\nand was killed. All his possessions went to a relative—an old woman\\r\\nnamed Dyna, who lives in the Emerald City. She went to the mountains\\r\\nwhere the Sorcerer had lived and brought away everything she thought of\\r\\nvalue. Among them was a small bottle of the Powder of Life; but of\\r\\ncourse Dyna didn\\'t know it was a magic Powder, at all. It happened she\\r\\nhad once had a big blue bear for a pet; but the bear choked to death on\\r\\na fishbone one day, and she loved it so dearly that Dyna made a rug of\\r\\nits skin, leaving the head and four paws on the hide. She kept the rug\\r\\non the floor of her front parlor.\"\\n\"I\\'ve seen rugs like that,\" said the shaggy man, nodding, \"but never one\\r\\nmade from a blue bear.\"\\n\"Well,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"the old woman had an idea that the\\r\\nPowder in the bottle must be moth-powder, because it smelled something\\r\\nlike moth-powder; so one day she sprinkled it on her bear rug to keep\\r\\nthe moths out of it. She said, looking lovingly at the skin: \\'I wish my\\r\\ndear bear were alive again!\\' To her horror the bear rug at once came to\\r\\nlife, having been sprinkled with the Magic Powder; and now this live\\r\\nbear rug is a great trial to her, and makes her a lot of trouble.\"\\n\"Why?\" asked the shaggy man.\\n\"Well, it stands up on its four feet and walks all around, and gets in\\r\\nthe way; and that spoils it for a rug. It can\\'t speak, although it is\\r\\nalive; for, while its head might say words, it has no breath in a solid\\r\\nbody to push the words out of its mouth. It\\'s a very slimpsy affair\\r\\naltogether, that bear rug, and the old woman is sorry it came to life.\\r\\nEvery day she has to scold it, and make it lie down flat on the parlor\\r\\nfloor to be walked upon; but sometimes when she goes to market the rug\\r\\nwill hump up its back skin, and stand on its four feet, and trot along\\r\\nafter her.\"\\n\\n\"I should think Dyna would like that,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Well, she doesn\\'t; because every one knows it isn\\'t a real bear, but\\r\\njust a hollow skin, and so of no actual use in the world except for a\\r\\nrug,\" answered the Tin Woodman. \"Therefore I believe it is a good thing\\r\\nthat all the magic Powder of Life is now used up, as it cannot cause\\r\\nany more trouble.\"\\n\"Perhaps you\\'re right,\" said the shaggy man, thoughtfully.\\nAt noon they stopped at a farm-house, where it delighted the farmer and\\r\\nhis wife to be able to give them a good luncheon. The farm people knew\\r\\nDorothy, having seen her when she was in the country before, and they\\r\\ntreated the little girl with as much respect as they did the Emperor,\\r\\nbecause she was a friend of the powerful Princess Ozma.\\nThey had not proceeded far after leaving this farm-house before coming\\r\\nto a high bridge over a broad river. This river, the Tin Woodman\\r\\ninformed them, was the boundary between the Country of the Winkies and\\r\\nthe territory of the Emerald City. The city itself was still a long way\\r\\noff, but all around it was a green meadow, as pretty as a well-kept\\r\\nlawn, and in this were neither houses nor farms to spoil the beauty of\\r\\nthe scene.\\nFrom the top of the high bridge they could see far away the magnificent\\r\\nspires and splendid domes of the superb city, sparkling like brilliant\\r\\njewels as they towered above the emerald walls. The shaggy man drew a\\r\\ndeep breath of awe and amazement, for never had he dreamed that such a\\r\\ngrand and beautiful place could exist—even in the fairyland of Oz.\\nPolly was so pleased that her violet eyes sparkled like amethysts, and\\r\\nshe danced away from her companions across the bridge and into a group\\r\\nof feathery trees lining both the roadsides. These trees she stopped to\\r\\nlook at with pleasure and surprise, for their leaves were shaped like\\r\\nostrich plumes, their feather edges beautifully curled; and all the\\r\\nplumes were tinted in the same dainty rainbow hues that appeared in\\r\\nPolychrome\\'s own pretty gauze gown.\\n\"Father ought to see these trees,\" she murmured; \"they are almost as\\r\\nlovely as his own rainbows.\"\\nThen she gave a start of terror, for beneath the trees came stalking two\\r\\ngreat beasts, either one big enough to crush the little Daughter of the\\r\\nRainbow with one blow of his paws, or to eat her up with one snap of his\\r\\nenormous jaws. One was a tawny lion, as tall as a horse, nearly; the\\r\\nother a striped tiger almost the same size.\\nPolly was too frightened to scream or to stir; she stood still with a\\r\\nwildly beating heart until Dorothy rushed past her and with a glad cry\\r\\nthrew her arms around the huge lion\\'s neck, hugging and kissing the\\r\\nbeast with evident joy.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m so glad to see you again!\" cried the little Kansas girl. \"And\\r\\nthe Hungry Tiger, too! How fine you\\'re both looking. Are you well and\\r\\nhappy?\"\\nDOROTHY THREW HER ARMS AROUND THE LION\\'S NECK\\n\"We certainly are, Dorothy,\" answered the Lion, in a deep voice that\\r\\nsounded pleasant and kind; \"and we are greatly pleased that you have\\r\\ncome to Ozma\\'s party. It\\'s going to be a grand affair, I promise you.\"\\n\"There will be lots of fat babies at the celebration, I hear,\" remarked\\r\\nthe Hungry Tiger, yawning so that his mouth opened dreadfully wide and\\r\\nshowed all his big, sharp teeth; \"but of course I can\\'t eat any of \\'em.\"\\n\"Is your Conscience still in good order?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.\\n\"Yes; it rules me like a tyrant,\" answered the Tiger, sorrowfully. \"I\\r\\ncan imagine nothing more unpleasant than to own a Conscience,\" and he\\r\\nwinked slyly at his friend the Lion.\\n\"You\\'re fooling me!\" said Dorothy, with a laugh. \"I don\\'t b\\'lieve you\\'d\\r\\neat a baby if you lost your Conscience. Come here, Polly,\" she called,\\r\\n\"and be introduced to my friends.\"\\nPolly advanced rather shyly.\\n\"You have some queer friends, Dorothy,\" she said.\\n\"The queerness doesn\\'t matter, so long as they\\'re friends,\" was the\\r\\nanswer. \"This is the Cowardly Lion, who isn\\'t a coward at all, but just\\r\\nthinks he is. The Wizard gave him some courage once, and he has part of\\r\\nit left.\"\\nThe Lion bowed with great dignity to Polly.\\n\"You are very lovely, my dear,\" said he. \"I hope we shall be friends\\r\\nwhen we are better acquainted.\"\\n\"And this is the Hungry Tiger,\" continued Dorothy. \"He says he longs to\\r\\neat fat babies; but the truth is he is never hungry at all, \\'cause he\\r\\ngets plenty to eat; and I don\\'t s\\'pose he\\'d hurt anybody even if he was\\r\\nhungry.\"\\n\"Hush, Dorothy,\" whispered the Tiger; \"you\\'ll ruin my reputation if you\\r\\nare not more discreet. It isn\\'t what we are, but what folks think we\\r\\nare, that counts in this world. And come to think of it Miss Polly would\\r\\nmake a fine variegated breakfast, I\\'m sure.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE others now came up, and the Tin Woodman greeted the Lion and the\\r\\nTiger cordially. Button-Bright yelled with fear when Dorothy first took\\r\\nhis hand and led him toward the great beasts; but the girl insisted they\\r\\nwere kind and good, and so the boy mustered up courage enough to pat\\r\\ntheir heads; after they had spoken to him gently and he had looked into\\r\\ntheir intelligent eyes his fear vanished entirely and he was so\\r\\ndelighted with the animals that he wanted to keep close to them and\\r\\nstroke their soft fur every minute.\\nAs for the shaggy man, he might have been afraid if he had met the\\r\\nbeasts alone, or in any other country; but so many were the marvels in\\r\\nthe Land of Oz that he was no longer easily surprised, and Dorothy\\'s\\r\\nfriendship for the Lion and Tiger was enough to assure him they were\\r\\nsafe companions. Toto barked at the Cowardly Lion in joyous greeting,\\r\\nfor he knew the beast of old and loved him, and it was funny to see how\\r\\ngently the Lion raised his huge paw to pat Toto\\'s head. The little dog\\r\\nsmelled of the Tiger\\'s nose and the Tiger politely shook paws with him;\\r\\nso they were quite likely to become firm friends.\\nTik-tok and Billina knew the beasts well, so merely bade them good day\\r\\nand asked after their healths and inquired about the Princess Ozma.\\nNow it was seen that the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger were drawing\\r\\nbehind them a splendid golden chariot, to which they were harnessed by\\r\\ngolden cords. The body of the chariot was decorated on the outside with\\r\\ndesigns in clusters of sparkling emeralds, while inside it was lined\\r\\nwith a green and gold satin, and the cushions of the seats were of green\\r\\nplush embroidered in gold with a crown, underneath which was a monogram.\\n\"Why, it\\'s Ozma\\'s own royal chariot!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\"Yes,\" said the Cowardly Lion; \"Ozma sent us to meet you here, for she\\r\\nfeared you would be weary with your long walk and she wished you to\\r\\nenter the City in a style becoming your exalted rank.\"\\n\"What!\" cried Polly, looking at Dorothy curiously. \"Do you belong to the\\r\\nnobility?\"\\n\\n\"Just in Oz I do,\" said the child, \"\\'cause Ozma made me a Princess, you\\r\\nknow. But when I\\'m home in Kansas I\\'m only a country girl, and have to\\r\\nhelp with the churning and wipe the dishes while Aunt Em washes \\'em. Do\\r\\nyou have to help wash dishes on the rainbow, Polly?\"\\n\"No, dear,\" answered Polychrome, smiling.\\n\"Well, I don\\'t have to work any in Oz, either,\" said Dorothy. \"It\\'s kind\\r\\nof fun to be a Princess once in a while; don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\"Dorothy and Polychrome and Button-Bright are all to ride in the\\r\\nchariot,\" said the Lion. \"So get in, my dears, and be careful not to mar\\r\\nthe gold or put your dusty feet on the embroidery.\"\\nButton-Bright was delighted to ride behind such a superb team, and he\\r\\ntold Dorothy it made him feel like an actor in a circus. As the strides\\r\\nof the animals brought them nearer to the Emerald City every one bowed\\r\\nrespectfully to the children, as well as to the Tin Woodman, Tik-tok,\\r\\nand the shaggy man, who were following behind.\\nThe Yellow Hen had perched upon the back of the chariot, where she could\\r\\ntell Dorothy more about her wonderful chickens as they rode. And so the\\r\\ngrand chariot came finally to the high wall surrounding the City, and\\r\\npaused before the magnificent jewel-studded gates.\\nThese were opened by a cheerful looking little man who wore green\\r\\nspectacles over his eyes. Dorothy introduced him to her friends as the\\r\\nGuardian of the Gates, and they noticed a big bunch of keys suspended on\\r\\nthe golden chain that hung around his neck. The chariot passed through\\r\\nthe outer gates into a fine arched chamber built in the thick wall, and\\r\\nthrough the inner gates into the streets of the Emerald City.\\nPolychrome exclaimed in rapture at the wondrous beauty that met her eyes\\r\\non every side as they rode through this stately and imposing City, the\\r\\nequal of which has never been discovered, even in Fairyland.\\r\\nButton-Bright could only say \"My!\" so amazing was the sight; but his\\r\\neyes were wide open and he tried to look in every direction at the same\\r\\ntime, so as not to miss anything.\\n\\nThe shaggy man was fairly astounded at what he saw, for the graceful and\\r\\nhandsome buildings were covered with plates of gold and set with\\r\\nemeralds so splendid and valuable that in any other part of the world\\r\\nany one of them would have been worth a fortune to its owner. The\\r\\nsidewalks were superb marble slabs polished as smooth as glass, and the\\r\\ncurbs that separated the walks from the broad street were also set thick\\r\\nwith clustered emeralds. There were many people on these walks—men,\\r\\nwomen, and children—all dressed in handsome garments of silk or satin\\r\\nor velvet, with beautiful jewels. Better even than this: all seemed\\r\\nhappy and contented, for their faces were smiling and free from care,\\r\\nand music and laughter might be heard on every side.\\n\"Don\\'t they work, at all?\" asked the shaggy man.\\n\"To be sure they work,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"this fair city could\\r\\nnot be built or cared for without labor, nor could the fruit and\\r\\nvegetables and other food be provided for the inhabitants to eat. But no\\r\\none works more than half his time, and the people of Oz enjoy their\\r\\nlabors as much as they do their play.\"\\n\"It\\'s wonderful!\" declared the shaggy man. \"I do hope Ozma will let me\\r\\nlive here.\"\\nThe chariot, winding through many charming streets, paused before a\\r\\nbuilding so vast and noble and elegant that even Button-Bright guessed\\r\\nat once that it was the Royal Palace. Its gardens and ample grounds were\\r\\nsurrounded by a separate wall, not so high or thick as the wall around\\r\\nthe City, but more daintily designed and built all of green marble. The\\r\\ngates flew open as the chariot appeared before them, and the Cowardly\\r\\nLion and Hungry Tiger trotted up a jeweled driveway to the front door of\\r\\nthe palace and stopped short.\\n\"Here we are!\" said Dorothy, gaily, and helped Button-Bright from the\\r\\nchariot. Polychrome leaped out lightly after them, and they were greeted\\r\\nby a crowd of gorgeously dressed servants who bowed low as the visitors\\r\\nmounted the marble steps. At their head was a pretty little maid with\\r\\ndark hair and eyes, dressed all in green embroidered with silver.\\r\\nDorothy ran up to her with evident pleasure, and exclaimed:\\n\"O Jellia Jamb! I\\'m so glad to see you again. Where\\'s Ozma?\"\\n\"In her room, your Highness,\" replied the little maid demurely, for this\\r\\nwas Ozma\\'s favorite attendant. \"She wishes you to come to her as soon as\\r\\nyou have rested and changed your dress, Princess Dorothy. And you and\\r\\nyour friends are to dine with her this evening.\"\\n\"When is her birthday, Jellia?\" asked the girl.\\n\"Day after to-morrow, your Highness.\"\\n\"And where\\'s the Scarecrow?\"\\n\"He\\'s gone into the Munchkin country to get some fresh straw to stuff\\r\\nhimself with, in honor of Ozma\\'s celebration,\" replied the maid. \"He\\r\\nreturns to the Emerald City to-morrow, he said.\"\\nBy this time Tik-tok, the Tin Woodman, and the shaggy man had arrived\\r\\nand the chariot had gone around to the back of the palace, Billina going\\r\\nwith the Lion and Tiger to see her chickens after her absence from them.\\r\\nBut Toto stayed close beside Dorothy.\\n\"O,\\r\\nJELLIA JAMB! I\\'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU\"\\n\"Come in, please,\" said Jellia Jamb; \"it shall be our pleasant duty to\\r\\nescort all of you to the rooms prepared for your use.\"\\nThe shaggy man hesitated. Dorothy had never known him to be ashamed of\\r\\nhis shaggy looks before, but now that he was surrounded by so much\\r\\nmagnificence and splendor the shaggy man felt sadly out of place.\\nDorothy assured him that all her friends were welcome at Ozma\\'s palace,\\r\\nso he carefully dusted his shaggy shoes with his shaggy handkerchief and\\r\\nentered the grand hall after the others.\\n\\nTik-tok lived at the Royal Palace and the Tin Woodman always had the\\r\\nsame room whenever he visited Ozma, so these two went at once to remove\\r\\nthe dust of the journey from their shining bodies. Dorothy also had a\\r\\npretty suite of rooms which she always occupied when in the Emerald\\r\\nCity; but several servants walked ahead politely to show the way,\\r\\nalthough she was quite sure she could find the rooms herself. She took\\r\\nButton-Bright with her, because he seemed too small to be left alone in\\r\\nsuch a big palace; but Jellia Jamb herself ushered the beautiful\\r\\nDaughter of the Rainbow to her apartments, because it was easy to see\\r\\nthat Polychrome was used to splendid palaces and was therefore entitled\\r\\nto especial attention.\\n\\n\\nTHE shaggy man stood in the great hall, his shaggy hat in his hands,\\r\\nwondering what would become of him. He had never been a guest in a fine\\r\\npalace before; perhaps he had never been a guest anywhere. In the big,\\r\\ncold, outside world people did not invite shaggy men to their homes, and\\r\\nthis shaggy man of ours had slept more in hay-lofts and stables than in\\r\\ncomfortable rooms. When the others left the great hall he eyed the\\r\\nsplendidly dressed servants of the Princess Ozma as if he expected to be\\r\\nordered out; but one of them bowed before him as respectfully as if he\\r\\nhad been a prince, and said:\\n\"Permit me, sir, to conduct you to your apartments.\"\\nThe shaggy man drew a long breath and took courage.\\n\"Very well,\" he answered; \"I\\'m ready.\"\\n\\nThrough the big hall they went, up the grand staircase carpeted thick\\r\\nwith velvet, and so along a wide corridor to a carved doorway. Here the\\r\\nservant paused, and opening the door said with polite deference:\\n\"Be good enough to enter, sir, and make yourself at home in the rooms\\r\\nour Royal Ozma has ordered prepared for you. Whatever you see is for you\\r\\nto use and enjoy, as if your own. The Princess dines at seven, and I\\r\\nshall be here in time to lead you to the drawing-room, where you will be\\r\\nprivileged to meet the lovely Ruler of Oz. Is there any command, in the\\r\\nmeantime, with which you desire to honor me?\"\\n\"No,\" said the shaggy man; \"but I\\'m much obliged.\"\\nHe entered the room and shut the door, and for a time stood in\\r\\nbewilderment, admiring the grandeur before him.\\nHe had been given one of the handsomest apartments in the most\\r\\nmagnificent palace in the world, and you can not wonder that his good\\r\\nfortune astonished and awed him until he grew used to his surroundings.\\nThe furniture was upholstered in cloth of gold, with the royal crown\\r\\nembroidered upon it in scarlet. The rug upon the marble floor was so\\r\\nthick and soft that he could not hear the sound of his own footsteps,\\r\\nand upon the walls were splendid tapestries woven with scenes from the\\r\\nLand of Oz. Books and ornaments were scattered about in profusion, and\\r\\nthe shaggy man thought he had never seen so many pretty things in one\\r\\nplace before. In one corner played a tinkling fountain of perfumed\\r\\nwater, and in another was a table bearing a golden tray loaded with\\r\\nfreshly gathered fruit, including several of the red-cheeked apples that\\r\\nthe shaggy man loved.\\nAt the farther end of this charming room was an open doorway, and he\\r\\ncrossed over to find himself in a bedroom containing more comforts than\\r\\nthe shaggy man had ever before imagined. The bedstead was of gold and\\r\\nset with many brilliant diamonds, and the coverlet had designs of\\r\\npearls and rubies sewed upon it. At one side of the bedroom was a dainty\\r\\ndressing-room, with closets containing a large assortment of fresh\\r\\nclothing; and beyond this was the bath—a large room having a marble\\r\\npool big enough to swim in, with white marble steps leading down to the\\r\\nwater. Around the edge of the pool were set rows of fine emeralds as\\r\\nlarge as door-knobs, while the water of the bath was clear as crystal.\\nTHE SHAGGY MAN ADMIRES HIS NEW CLOTHES\\nFor a time the shaggy man gazed upon all this luxury with silent\\r\\namazement. Then he decided, being wise in his way, to take advantage of\\r\\nhis good fortune. He removed his shaggy boots and his shaggy clothing,\\r\\nand bathed in the pool with rare enjoyment. After he had dried himself\\r\\nwith the soft towels he went into the dressing-room and took fresh linen\\r\\nfrom the drawers and put it on, finding that everything fitted him\\r\\nexactly. He examined the contents of the closets and selected an elegant\\r\\nsuit of clothing. Strangely enough, everything about it was shaggy,\\r\\nalthough so new and beautiful, and he sighed with contentment to realize\\r\\nthat he could now be finely dressed and still be the Shaggy Man. His\\r\\ncoat was of rose-colored velvet, trimmed with shags and bobtails, with\\r\\nbuttons of blood-red rubies and golden shags around the edges. His vest\\r\\nwas a shaggy satin of a delicate cream color, and his knee-breeches of\\r\\nrose velvet trimmed like the coat. Shaggy creamy stockings of silk, and\\r\\nshaggy slippers of rose leather with ruby buckles, completed his\\r\\ncostume, and when he was thus attired the shaggy man looked at himself\\r\\nin a long mirror with great admiration. On a table he found a\\r\\nmother-of-pearl chest decorated with delicate silver vines and flowers\\r\\nof clustered rubies, and on the cover was a silver plate engraved with\\r\\nthese words:\\n\\nTHE SHAGGY MAN:HIS BOX OF ORNAMENTS\\nThe chest was not locked, so he opened it and was almost dazzled by the\\r\\nbrilliance of the rich jewels it contained. After admiring the pretty\\r\\nthings, he took out a fine golden watch with a big chain, several\\r\\nhandsome finger-rings, and an ornament of rubies to pin upon the breast\\r\\nof his shaggy shirt-bosom. Having carefully brushed his hair and\\r\\nwhiskers all the wrong way, to make them look as shaggy as possible, the\\r\\nshaggy man breathed a deep sigh of joy and decided he was ready to meet\\r\\nthe Royal Princess as soon as she sent for him. While he waited he\\r\\nreturned to the beautiful sitting room and ate several of the\\r\\nred-cheeked apples to pass away the time.\\nMeanwhile Dorothy had dressed herself in a pretty gown of soft grey\\r\\nembroidered with silver, and put a blue-and-gold suit of satin upon\\r\\nlittle Button-Bright, who looked as sweet as a cherub in it. Followed\\r\\nby the boy and Toto—the dog with a new green ribbon around his\\r\\nneck—she hastened down to the splendid drawing-room of the palace,\\r\\nwhere, seated upon an exquisite throne of carved malachite and nestled\\r\\namongst its green satin cushions was the lovely Princess Ozma, waiting\\r\\neagerly to welcome her friend.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE royal historians of Oz, who are fine writers and know any number of\\r\\nbig words, have often tried to describe the rare beauty of Ozma and\\r\\nfailed because the words were not good enough. So of course I can not\\r\\nhope to tell you how great was the charm of this little Princess, or how\\r\\nher loveliness put to shame all the sparkling jewels and magnificent\\r\\nluxury that surrounded her in this her royal palace. Whatever else was\\r\\nbeautiful or dainty or delightful of itself faded to dullness when\\r\\ncontrasted with Ozma\\'s bewitching face, and it has often been said by\\r\\nthose who know that no other ruler in all the world can ever hope to\\r\\nequal the gracious charm of her manner.\\nEverything about Ozma attracted one, and she inspired love and the\\r\\nsweetest affection rather than awe or ordinary admiration. Dorothy threw\\r\\nher arms around her little friend and hugged and kissed her rapturously,\\r\\nand Toto barked joyfully and Button-Bright smiled a happy smile and\\r\\nconsented to sit on the soft cushions close beside the Princess.\\n\"Why didn\\'t you send me word you were going to have a birthday party?\"\\r\\nasked the little Kansas girl, when the first greetings were over.\\n\"Didn\\'t I?\" asked Ozma, her pretty eyes dancing with merriment.\\n\"Did you?\" replied Dorothy, trying to think.\\n\"Who do you imagine, dear, mixed up those roads, so as to start you\\r\\nwandering in the direction of Oz?\" inquired the Princess.\\n\"Oh! I never \\'spected you of that,\" cried Dorothy.\\n\"I\\'ve watched you in my Magic Picture all the way here,\" declared Ozma,\\r\\n\"and twice I thought I should have to use the Magic Belt to save you and\\r\\ntransport you to the Emerald City. Once was when the Scoodlers caught\\r\\nyou, and again when you reached the Deadly Desert. But the shaggy man\\r\\nwas able to help you out both times, so I did not interfere.\"\\n\"Do you know who Button-Bright is?\" asked Dorothy.\\n\\n\"No; I never saw him until you found him in the road, and then only in\\r\\nmy Magic Picture.\"\\n\"And did you send Polly to us?\"\\n\"No, dear; the Rainbow\\'s Daughter slid from her father\\'s pretty arch\\r\\njust in time to meet you.\"\\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I\\'ve promised King Dox of Foxville and King\\r\\nKik-a-bray of Dunkiton that I\\'d ask you to invite them to your party.\"\\n\"I have already done that,\" returned Ozma, \"because I thought it would\\r\\nplease you to favor them.\"\\n\"Did you \\'vite the Musicker?\" asked Button-Bright.\\n\"No; because he would be too noisy, and might interfere with the comfort\\r\\nof others. When music is not very good, and is indulged in all the\\r\\ntime, it is better that the performer should be alone,\" said the\\r\\nPrincess.\\n\"I like the Musicker\\'s music,\" declared the boy, gravely.\\n\"But I don\\'t,\" said Dorothy.\\n\"Well, there will be plenty of music at my celebration,\" promised Ozma;\\r\\n\"so I\\'ve an idea Button-Bright won\\'t miss the Musicker at all.\"\\nJust then Polychrome danced in, and Ozma rose to greet the Rainbow\\'s\\r\\nDaughter in her sweetest and most cordial manner.\\nDorothy thought she had never seen two prettier creatures together than\\r\\nthese lovely maidens; but Polly knew at once her own dainty beauty could\\r\\nnot match that of Ozma, yet was not a bit jealous because this was so.\\nThe Wizard of Oz was announced, and a dried-up, little, old man, clothed\\r\\nall in black, entered the drawing-room. His face was cheery and his eyes\\r\\ntwinkling with humor, so Polly and Button-Bright were not at all afraid\\r\\nof the wonderful personage whose fame as a humbug magician had spread\\r\\nthroughout the world. After greeting Dorothy with much affection, he\\r\\nstood modestly behind Ozma\\'s throne and listened to the lively prattle\\r\\nof the young people.\\nNow the shaggy man appeared, and so startling was his appearance, all\\r\\nclad in shaggy new raiment, that Dorothy cried \"Oh!\" and clasped her\\r\\nhands impulsively as she examined her friend with pleased eyes.\\n\\n\"He\\'s still shaggy, all right,\" remarked Button-Bright; and Ozma nodded\\r\\nbrightly because she had meant the shaggy man to remain shaggy when she\\r\\nprovided his new clothes for him.\\nDorothy led him toward the throne, as he was shy in such fine company,\\r\\nand presented him gracefully to the Princess, saying:\\n\"This, your Highness, is my friend, the shaggy man, who owns the Love\\r\\nMagnet.\"\\n\"You are welcome to Oz,\" said the girl Ruler, in gracious accents. \"But\\r\\ntell me, sir, where did you get the Love Magnet which you say you own?\"\\nThe shaggy man grew red and looked downcast, as he answered in a low\\r\\nvoice:\\n\"I stole it, your Majesty.\"\\n\"Oh, Shaggy Man!\" cried Dorothy. \"How dreadful! And you told me the\\r\\nEskimo gave you the Love Magnet.\"\\nHe shuffled first on one foot and then on the other, much embarrassed.\\n\"I told you a falsehood, Dorothy,\" he said; \"but now, having bathed in\\r\\nthe Truth Pond, I must tell nothing but the truth.\"\\n\"Why did you steal it?\" asked Ozma, gently.\\n\"Because no one loved me, or cared for me,\" said the shaggy man, \"and I\\r\\nwanted to be loved a great deal. It was owned by a girl in Butterfield\\r\\nwho was loved too much, so that the young men quarreled over her, which\\r\\nmade her unhappy. After I had stolen the Magnet from her, only one young\\r\\nman continued to love the girl, and she married him and regained her\\r\\nhappiness.\"\\n\"Are you sorry you stole it?\" asked the Princess.\\n\"No, your Highness; I\\'m glad,\" he answered; \"for it has pleased me to be\\r\\nloved, and if Dorothy had not cared for me I could not have accompanied\\r\\nher to this beautiful Land of Oz, or met its kind-hearted Ruler. Now\\r\\nthat I\\'m here, I hope to remain, and to become one of your Majesty\\'s\\r\\nmost faithful subjects.\"\\nIN THE ROYAL PALACE OF OZ\\n\"But in Oz we are loved for ourselves alone, and for our kindness to one\\r\\nanother, and for our good deeds,\" she said.\\n\"I\\'ll give up the Love Magnet,\" said the shaggy man, eagerly; \"Dorothy\\r\\nshall have it.\"\\n\"But every one loves Dorothy already,\" declared the Wizard.\\n\"Then Button-Bright shall have it.\"\\n\"Don\\'t want it,\" said the boy, promptly.\\n\"Then I\\'ll give it to the Wizard, for I\\'m sure the lovely Princess Ozma\\r\\ndoes not need it.\"\\n\"All my people love the Wizard, too,\" announced the Princess, laughing;\\r\\n\"so we will hang the Love Magnet over the gates of the Emerald City,\\r\\nthat whoever shall enter or leave the gates may be loved and loving.\"\\n\"That is a good idea,\" said the shaggy man; \"I agree to it most\\r\\nwillingly.\"\\nThose assembled now went in to dinner, which you may imagine was a grand\\r\\naffair; and afterward Ozma asked the Wizard to give them an exhibition\\r\\nof his magic.\\nThe Wizard took eight tiny white piglets from an inside pocket and set\\r\\nthem on the table. One was dressed like a clown, and performed funny\\r\\nantics, and the others leaped over the spoons and dishes and ran around\\r\\nthe table like racehorses, and turned hand-springs and were so\\r\\nsprightly and amusing that they kept the company in one roar of merry\\r\\nlaughter. The Wizard had trained these pets to do many curious things,\\r\\nand they were so little and so cunning and soft that Polychrome loved to\\r\\npick them up as they passed near her place and fondle them as if they\\r\\nwere kittens.\\nIt was late when the entertainment ended, and they separated to go to\\r\\ntheir rooms.\\n\\n\"To-morrow,\" said Ozma, \"my invited guests will arrive, and you will\\r\\nfind among them some interesting and curious people, I promise you. The\\r\\nnext day will be my birthday, and the festivities will be held on the\\r\\nbroad green just outside the gates of the City, where all my people can\\r\\nassemble without being crowded.\"\\n\"I hope the Scarecrow won\\'t be late,\" said Dorothy, anxiously.\\n\"Oh, he is sure to return to-morrow,\" answered Ozma. \"He wanted new\\r\\nstraw to stuff himself with, so he went to the Munchkin Country, where\\r\\nstraw is plentiful.\"\\nWith this the Princess bade her guests good night and went to her own\\r\\nroom.\\n\\n\\nNEXT morning Dorothy\\'s breakfast was served in her own pretty sitting\\r\\nroom, and she sent to invite Polly and the shaggy man to join her and\\r\\nButton-Bright at the meal. They came gladly, and Toto also had breakfast\\r\\nwith them, so that the little party that had traveled together to Oz was\\r\\nonce more reunited.\\nNo sooner had they finished eating than they heard the distant blast of\\r\\nmany trumpets, and the sound of a brass band playing martial music; so\\r\\nthey all went out upon the balcony. This was at the front of the palace\\r\\nand overlooked the streets of the City, being higher than the wall that\\r\\nshut in the palace grounds. They saw approaching down the street a band\\r\\nof musicians, playing as hard and loud as they could, while the people\\r\\nof the Emerald City crowded the sidewalks and cheered so lustily that\\r\\nthey almost drowned the noise of the drums and horns.\\n\\nDorothy looked to see what they were cheering at, and discovered that\\r\\nbehind the band was the famous Scarecrow, riding proudly upon the back\\r\\nof a wooden Saw-Horse which pranced along the street almost as\\r\\ngracefully as if it had been made of flesh. Its hoofs, or rather the\\r\\nends of its wooden legs, were shod with plates of solid gold, and the\\r\\nsaddle strapped to the wooden body was richly embroidered and glittered\\r\\nwith jewels.\\nAs he reached the palace the Scarecrow looked up and saw Dorothy, and at\\r\\nonce waved his peaked hat at her in greeting. He rode up to the front\\r\\ndoor and dismounted, and the band stopped playing and went away and the\\r\\ncrowds of people returned to their dwellings.\\nBy the time Dorothy and her friends had re-entered her room the\\r\\nScarecrow was there, and he gave the girl a hearty embrace and shook the\\r\\nhands of the others with his own squashy hands, which were white gloves\\r\\nfilled with straw.\\nThe shaggy man, Button-Bright, and Polychrome stared hard at this\\r\\ncelebrated person, who was acknowledged to be the most popular and most\\r\\nbeloved man in all the Land of Oz.\\n\"Why, your face has been newly painted!\" exclaimed Dorothy, when the\\r\\nfirst greetings were over.\\n\"I had it touched up a bit by the Munchkin farmer who first made me,\"\\r\\nanswered the Scarecrow, pleasantly. \"My complexion had become a bit grey\\r\\nand faded, you know, and the paint had peeled off one end of my mouth,\\r\\nso I couldn\\'t talk quite straight. Now I feel like myself again, and I\\r\\nmay say without immodesty that my body is stuffed with the loveliest\\r\\noat-straw in all Oz.\" He pushed against his chest. \"Hear me crunkle?\" he\\r\\nasked.\\n\"Yes,\" said Dorothy; \"you sound fine.\"\\nButton-Bright was wonderfully attracted by the straw man, and so was\\r\\nPolly. The shaggy man treated him with great respect, because he was so\\r\\nqueerly made.\\nJellia Jamb now came to say that Ozma wanted Princess Dorothy to receive\\r\\nthe invited guests in the Throne-Room, as they arrived. The Ruler was\\r\\nherself busy ordering the preparations for the morrow\\'s festivities, so\\r\\nshe wished her friend to act in her place.\\nDorothy willingly agreed, being the only other Princess in the Emerald\\r\\nCity; so she went to the great Throne-Room and sat in Ozma\\'s seat,\\r\\nplacing Polly on one side of her and Button-Bright on the other. The\\r\\nScarecrow stood at the left of the throne and the Tin Woodman at the\\r\\nright, while the Wonderful Wizard and the shaggy man stood behind.\\nThe Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger came in, with bright new bows of\\r\\nribbon on their collars and tails. After greeting Dorothy affectionately\\r\\nthe huge beasts lay down at the foot of the throne.\\nWhile they waited, the Scarecrow, who was near the little boy, asked:\\n\"Why are you called Button-Bright?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" was the answer.\\n\"Oh yes, you do, dear,\" said Dorothy. \"Tell the Scarecrow how you got\\r\\nyour name.\"\\n\"Papa always said I was bright as a button, so mamma always called me\\r\\nButton-Bright,\" announced the boy.\\n\"Where is your mamma?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Where is your home?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Don\\'t you want to find your mamma again?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright, calmly.\\nThe Scarecrow looked thoughtful.\\n\"Your papa may have been right,\" he observed; \"but there are many kinds\\r\\nof buttons, you see. There are silver and gold buttons, which are highly\\r\\npolished and glitter brightly. There are pearl and rubber buttons, and\\r\\nother kinds, with surfaces more or less bright. But there is still\\r\\nanother sort of button which is covered with dull cloth, and that must\\r\\nbe the sort your papa meant when he said you were bright as a button.\\r\\nDon\\'t you think so?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\nJack Pumpkinhead arrived, wearing a pair of new white kid gloves; and he\\r\\nbrought a birthday present for Ozma consisting of a necklace of\\r\\npumpkin-seeds. In each seed was set a sparkling carolite, which is\\r\\nconsidered the rarest and most beautiful gem that exists. The necklace\\r\\nwas in a plush case and Jellia Jamb put it on a table with the Princess\\r\\nOzma\\'s other presents.\\nNext came a tall, beautiful woman clothed in a splendid trailing gown,\\r\\ntrimmed with exquisite lace as fine as cobweb. This was the important\\r\\nSorceress known as Glinda the Good, who had been of great assistance to\\r\\nboth Ozma and Dorothy. There was no humbug about her magic, you may be\\r\\nsure, and Glinda was as kind as she was powerful. She greeted Dorothy\\r\\nmost lovingly, and kissed Button-Bright and Polly, and smiled upon the\\r\\nshaggy man, after which Jellia Jamb led the Sorceress to one of the most\\r\\nmagnificent rooms of the royal palace and appointed fifty servants to\\r\\nwait upon her.\\n\\nThe next arrival was Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.; the \"H. M.\" meaning\\r\\nHighly Magnified and the \"T. E.\" meaning Thoroughly Educated. The\\r\\nWoggle-Bug was head professor at the Royal College of Oz, and he had\\r\\ncomposed a fine Ode in honor of Ozma\\'s birthday. This he wanted to read\\r\\nto them; but the Scarecrow wouldn\\'t let him.\\nSoon they heard a clucking sound and a chorus of \"cheep! cheep!\" and a\\r\\nservant threw open the door to allow Billina and her ten fluffy chicks\\r\\nto enter the Throne-Room. As the Yellow Hen marched proudly at the head\\r\\nof her family, Dorothy cried, \"Oh, you lovely things!\" and ran down from\\r\\nher seat to pet the little yellow downy balls. Billina wore a pearl\\r\\nnecklace, and around the neck of each chicken was a tiny gold chain\\r\\nholding a locket with the letter \"D\" engraved upon the outside.\\n\"Open the lockets, Dorothy,\" said Billina. The girl obeyed and found a\\r\\npicture of herself in each locket. \"They were named after you, my dear,\"\\r\\ncontinued the Yellow Hen, \"so I wanted all my chickens to wear your\\r\\npicture. Cluck—cluck! come here, Dorothy—this minute!\" she cried, for\\r\\nthe chickens were scattered and wandering all around the big room.\\nThey obeyed the call at once, and came running as fast as they could,\\r\\nfluttering their fluffy wings in a laughable way.\\nIt was lucky that Billina gathered the little ones under her soft breast\\r\\njust then, for Tik-tok came in and tramped up to the throne on his flat\\r\\ncopper feet.\\n\"I am all wound up and work-ing fine-ly,\" said the clockwork man to\\r\\nDorothy.\\n\"I can hear him tick,\" declared Button-Bright.\\n\"You are quite the polished gentleman,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"Stand up\\r\\nhere beside the shaggy man, Tik-tok, and help receive the company.\"\\nDorothy placed soft cushions in a corner for Billina and her chicks, and\\r\\nhad just returned to the Throne and seated herself when the playing of\\r\\nthe royal band outside the palace announced the approach of\\r\\ndistinguished guests.\\nAnd my, how they did stare when the High Chamberlain threw open the\\r\\ndoors and the visitors entered the Throne-Room!\\nFirst walked a gingerbread man, neatly formed and baked to a lovely\\r\\nbrown tint. He wore a silk hat and carried a candy cane prettily striped\\r\\nwith red and yellow. His shirt-front and cuffs were white frosting, and\\r\\nthe buttons on his coat were licorice drops.\\nBehind the gingerbread man came a child with flaxen hair and merry blue\\r\\neyes, dressed in white pajamas, with sandals on the soles of its pretty\\r\\nbare feet. The child looked around smiling and thrust its hands into the\\r\\npockets of the pajamas. Close after it came a big rubber bear, walking\\r\\nerect on its hind feet. The bear had twinkling black eyes and its body\\r\\nlooked as if it had been pumped full of air.\\nFollowing these curious visitors were two tall, thin men and two short,\\r\\nfat men, all four dressed in gorgeous uniforms.\\nKING DOUGH, THE HEAD BOOLEYWAG, AND PARA BRUIN\\nOzma\\'s High Chamberlain now hurried forward to announce the names of the\\r\\nnew arrivals, calling out in a loud voice:\\n\"His Gracious and Most Edible Majesty, King Dough the First, Ruler of\\r\\nthe Two Kingdoms of Hiland and Loland. Also the Head Booleywag of his\\r\\nMajesty, known as Chick the Cherub, and their faithful friend Para\\r\\nBruin, the rubber bear.\"\\nThese great personages bowed low as their names were called, and Dorothy\\r\\nhastened to introduce them to the assembled company. They were the first\\r\\nforeign arrivals, and the friends of Princess Ozma were polite to them\\r\\nand tried to make them feel that they were welcome.\\nChick the Cherub shook hands with every one, including Billina, and was\\r\\nso joyous and frank and full of good spirits that John Dough\\'s Head\\r\\nBooleywag at once became a prime favorite.\\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" whispered Dorothy.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\n\"Goodness me! what a queer lot of people you are,\" exclaimed the rubber\\r\\nbear, looking at the assembled company.\\n\"So\\'re you,\" said Button-Bright, gravely. \"Is King Dough good to eat?\"\\n\"He\\'s too good to eat,\" laughed Chick the Cherub.\\n\"I hope none of you are fond of gingerbread,\" said the King, rather\\r\\nanxiously.\\n\"We should never think of eating our visitors, if we were,\" declared the\\r\\nScarecrow; \"so please do not worry, for you will be perfectly safe while\\r\\nyou remain in Oz.\"\\n\"Why do they call you Chick?\" the Yellow Hen asked the child.\\n\"Because I\\'m an Incubator Baby, and never had any parents,\" replied the\\r\\nHead Booleywag.\\n\"My chicks have a parent, and I\\'m it,\" said Billina.\\n\"I\\'m glad of that,\" answered the Cherub, \"because they\\'ll have more fun\\r\\nworrying you than if they were brought up in an Incubator. The Incubator\\r\\nnever worries, you know.\"\\n\\nKing John Dough had brought for Ozma\\'s birthday present a lovely\\r\\ngingerbread crown, with rows of small pearls around it and a fine big\\r\\npearl in each of its five points. After this had been received by\\r\\nDorothy with proper thanks and placed on the table with the other\\r\\npresents, the visitors from Hiland and Loland were escorted to their\\r\\nrooms by the High Chamberlain.\\nThey had no sooner departed than the band before the palace began to\\r\\nplay again, announcing more arrivals, and as these were doubtless from\\r\\nforeign parts the High Chamberlain hurried back to receive them in his\\r\\nmost official manner.\\n\\n\\nFIRST entered a band of Ryls from the Happy Valley, all merry little\\r\\nsprites like fairy elves. A dozen crooked Knooks followed from the great\\r\\nForest of Burzee. They had long whiskers and pointed caps and curling\\r\\ntoes, yet were no taller than Button-Bright\\'s shoulder. With this group\\r\\ncame a man so easy to recognize and so important and dearly beloved\\r\\nthroughout the known world, that all present rose to their feet and\\r\\nbowed their heads in respectful homage, even before the High Chamberlain\\r\\nknelt to announce his name.\\n\"The most Mighty and Loyal Friend of Children, His Supreme\\r\\nHighness—Santa Claus!\" said the Chamberlain, in an awed voice.\\n\"Well, well, well! Glad to see you—glad to meet you all!\" cried Santa\\r\\nClaus, briskly, as he trotted up the long room.\\nHe was round as an apple, with a fresh rosy face, laughing eyes, and a\\r\\nbushy beard as white as snow. A red cloak trimmed with beautiful ermine\\r\\nhung from his shoulders and upon his back was a basket filled with\\r\\npretty presents for the Princess Ozma.\\n\"Hello, Dorothy; still having adventures?\" he asked in his jolly way, as\\r\\nhe took the girl\\'s hand in both his own.\\n\"How did you know my name, Santa?\" she replied, feeling more shy in the\\r\\npresence of this immortal saint than she ever had before in her young\\r\\nlife.\\n\"Why, don\\'t I see you every Christmas Eve, when you\\'re asleep?\" he\\r\\nrejoined, pinching her blushing cheek.\\n\"Oh; do you?\"\\n\"And here\\'s Button-Bright, I declare!\" cried Santa Claus, holding up the\\r\\nboy to kiss him. \"What a long way from home you are; dear me!\"\\n\"Do you know Button-Bright, too?\" questioned Dorothy, eagerly.\\n\"Indeed I do. I\\'ve visited his home several Christmas Eves.\"\\n\"And do you know his father?\" asked the girl.\\nMERRY RYLS AND CROOKED KNOOKS\\n\"Certainly, my dear. Who else do you suppose brings him his Christmas\\r\\nneckties and stockings?\" with a sly wink at the Wizard.\\n\"Then where does he live? We\\'re just crazy to know, \\'cause\\r\\nButton-Bright\\'s lost,\" she said.\\nSanta laughed and laid his finger aside of his nose as if thinking what\\r\\nto reply. He leaned over and whispered something in the Wizard\\'s ear, at\\r\\nwhich the Wizard smiled and nodded as if he understood.\\nNow Santa Claus spied Polychrome, and trotted over to where she stood.\\n\"Seems to me the Rainbow\\'s Daughter is farther from home than any of\\r\\nyou,\" he observed, looking at the pretty maiden admiringly. \"I\\'ll have\\r\\nto tell your father where you are, Polly, and send him to get you.\"\\n\"Please do, dear Santa Claus,\" implored the little maid, beseechingly.\\n\"But just now we must all have a jolly good time at Ozma\\'s party,\" said\\r\\nthe old gentlemen, turning to put his presents on the table with the\\r\\nothers already there. \"It isn\\'t often I find time to leave my castle, as\\r\\nyou know; but Ozma invited me and I just couldn\\'t help coming to\\r\\ncelebrate the happy occasion.\"\\n\"I\\'m so glad!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\\n\"These are my Ryls,\" pointing to the little sprites squatting around\\r\\nhim. \"Their business is to paint the colors of the flowers when they\\r\\nbud and bloom; but I brought the merry fellows along to see Oz, and\\r\\nthey\\'ve left their paint-pots behind them. Also I brought these crooked\\r\\nKnooks, whom I love. My dears, the Knooks are much nicer than they look,\\r\\nfor their duty is to water and care for the young trees of the forest,\\r\\nand they do their work faithfully and well. It\\'s hard work, though, and\\r\\nit makes my Knooks crooked and gnarled, like the trees themselves; but\\r\\ntheir hearts are big and kind, as are the hearts of all who do good in\\r\\nour beautiful world.\"\\n\"I\\'ve read of the Ryls and Knooks,\" said Dorothy, looking upon these\\r\\nlittle workers with interest.\\nSanta Claus turned to talk with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and\\r\\nhe also said a kind word to the shaggy man, and afterward went away to\\r\\nride the Saw-horse around the Emerald City. \"For,\" said he, \"I must see\\r\\nall the grand sights while I am here and have the chance, and Ozma has\\r\\npromised to let me ride the Saw-Horse because I\\'m getting fat and short\\r\\nof breath.\"\\n\"Where are your reindeer?\" asked Polychrome.\\n\"I left them at home, for it is too warm for them in this sunny\\r\\ncountry,\" he answered. \"They\\'re used to winter weather when they\\r\\ntravel.\"\\nIn a flash he was gone, and the Ryls and Knooks with him; but they could\\r\\nall hear the golden hoofs of the Saw-Horse ringing on the marble\\r\\npavement outside, as he pranced away with his noble rider.\\nPresently the band played again, and the High Chamberlain announced:\\n\\n\"Her Gracious Majesty, the Queen of Merryland.\"\\nThey looked earnestly to discover whom this queen might be, and saw\\r\\nadvancing up the room an exquisite wax doll, dressed in dainty fluffs\\r\\nand ruffles and spangled gown. She was almost as big as Button-Bright,\\r\\nand her cheeks and mouth and eyebrow were prettily painted in delicate\\r\\ncolors. Her blue eyes stared a bit, being of glass, yet the expression\\r\\nupon her Majesty\\'s face was quite pleasant and decidedly winning. With\\r\\nthe Queen of Merryland were four wooden soldiers, two stalking ahead of\\r\\nher with much dignity and two following behind, like a royal bodyguard.\\r\\nThe soldiers were painted in bright colors and carried wooden guns, and\\r\\nafter them came a fat little man who attracted attention at once,\\r\\nalthough he seemed modest and retiring. For he was made of candy, and\\r\\ncarried a tin sugar-sifter filled with powdered sugar, with which he\\r\\ndusted himself frequently so that he wouldn\\'t stick to things if he\\r\\ntouched them. The High Chamberlain had called him \"The Candy Man of\\r\\nMerryland,\" and Dorothy saw that one of his thumbs looked as if it had\\r\\nbeen bitten off by some who was fond of candy and couldn\\'t resist the\\r\\ntemptation.\\nThe wax doll Queen spoke prettily to Dorothy and the others, and sent\\r\\nher loving greetings to Ozma before she retired to the rooms prepared\\r\\nfor her. She had brought a birthday present wrapped in tissue paper and\\r\\ntied with pink and blue ribbons, and one of the wooden soldiers placed\\r\\nit on the table with the other gifts. But the Candy Man did not go to\\r\\nhis room, because he said he preferred to stay and talk with the\\r\\nScarecrow and Tik-tok and the Wizard and Tin Woodman, whom he declared\\r\\nthe queerest people he had ever met. Button-Bright was glad the Candy\\r\\nMan stayed in the Throne-room, because the boy thought this guest\\r\\nsmelled deliciously of wintergreen and maple sugar.\\nThe Braided Man now entered the room, having been fortunate enough to\\r\\nreceive an invitation to the Princess Ozma\\'s party. He was from a cave\\r\\nhalfway between the Invisible Valley and the Country of the Gargoyles,\\r\\nand his hair and whiskers were so long that he was obliged to plait them\\r\\ninto many braids that hung to his feet, and every braid was tied with a\\r\\nbow of colored ribbon.\\n\"I\\'ve brought Princess Ozma a box of flutters for her birthday,\" said\\r\\nthe Braided Man, earnestly; \"and I hope she will like them, for they are\\r\\nthe finest quality I have ever made.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sure she will be greatly pleased,\" said Dorothy, who remembered\\r\\nthe Braided Man well; and the Wizard introduced the guest to the rest of\\r\\nthe company and made him sit down in a chair and keep quiet, for, if\\r\\nallowed, he would talk continually about his flutters.\\nThe band then played a welcome to another set of guests, and into the\\r\\nThrone-Room swept the handsome and stately Queen of Ev. Beside her was\\r\\nyoung King Evardo, and following them came the entire royal family of\\r\\nfive Princesses and four Princes of Ev. The Kingdom of Ev lay just\\r\\nacross the Deadly Desert to the North of Oz, and once Ozma and her\\r\\npeople had rescued the Queen of Ev and her ten children from the Nome\\r\\nKing, who had enslaved them. Dorothy had been present on this adventure,\\r\\nso she greeted the royal family cordially; and all the visitors were\\r\\ndelighted to meet the little Kansas girl again. They knew Tik-tok and\\r\\nBillina, too, and the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, as well as the Lion and\\r\\nTiger; so there was a joyful reunion, as you may imagine, and it was\\r\\nfully an hour before the Queen and her train retired to their rooms.\\r\\nPerhaps they would not have gone then had not the band begun to play to\\r\\nannounce new arrivals; but before they left the great Throne-Room King\\r\\nEvardo added to Ozma\\'s birthday presents a diadem of diamonds set in\\r\\nradium.\\nThe next comer proved to be King Renard of Foxville; or King Dox, as he\\r\\npreferred to be called. He was magnificently dressed in a new feather\\r\\ncostume and wore white kid mittens over his paws and a flower in his\\r\\nbutton-hole and had his hair parted in the middle.\\nKing Dox thanked Dorothy fervently for getting him the invitation to\\r\\ncome to Oz, which he had all his life longed to visit. He strutted\\r\\naround rather absurdly as he was introduced to all the famous people\\r\\nassembled in the Throne-Room, and when he learned that Dorothy was a\\r\\nPrincess of Oz the Fox King insisted on kneeling at her feet and\\r\\nafterward retired backward—a dangerous thing to do, as he might have\\r\\nstubbed his paw and tumbled over.\\nNo sooner was he gone than the blasts of bugles and clatter of drums and\\r\\ncymbals announced important visitors, and the High Chamberlain assumed\\r\\nhis most dignified tone as he threw open the door and said proudly:\\n\"Her Sublime and Resplendent Majesty, Queen Zixi of Ix! His Serene and\\r\\nTremendous Majesty, King Bud of Noland. Her Royal Highness, the Princess\\r\\nFluff.\"\\nHER MAJESTY, QUEEN ZIXI OF IX\\nThat three such high and mighty royal personages should arrive at once\\r\\nwas enough to make Dorothy and her companions grow solemn and assume\\r\\ntheir best company manners; but when the exquisite beauty of Queen Zixi\\r\\nmet their eyes they thought they had never beheld anything so charming.\\r\\nDorothy decided that Zixi must be about sixteen years old, but the\\r\\nWizard whispered to her that this wonderful queen had lived thousands\\r\\nof years, but knew the secret of remaining always fresh and beautiful.\\nKing Bud of Noland and his dainty fair-haired sister, the Princess\\r\\nFluff, were friends of Zixi, as their kingdoms were adjoining, so they\\r\\nhad traveled together from their far-off domains to do honor to Ozma of\\r\\nOz on the occasion of her birthday. They brought many splendid gifts; so\\r\\nthe table was now fairly loaded down with presents.\\nDorothy and Polly loved the Princess Fluff the moment they saw her, and\\r\\nlittle King Bud was so frank and boyish that Button-Bright accepted him\\r\\nas a chum at once and did not want him to go away. But it was after noon\\r\\nnow, and the royal guests must prepare their toilets for the grand\\r\\nbanquet at which they were to assemble that evening to meet the reigning\\r\\nPrincess of this Fairyland; so Queen Zixi was shown to her room by a\\r\\ntroop of maidens led by Jellia Jamb, and Bud and Fluff presently\\r\\nwithdrew to their own apartments.\\n\"My! what a big party Ozma is going to have,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I\\r\\nguess the palace will be chock full, Button-Bright; don\\'t you think so?\"\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said the boy.\\n\"But we must go to our rooms, pretty soon, to dress for the banquet,\"\\r\\ncontinued the girl.\\n\"I don\\'t have to dress,\" said the Candy Man from Merryland. \"All I need\\r\\ndo is to dust myself with fresh sugar.\"\\n\\n\"Tik-tok and I always wear the same suits of clothes,\" said the Tin\\r\\nWoodman; \"and so does our friend the Scarecrow.\"\\n\"My feathers are good enough for any occasion,\" cried Billina, from her\\r\\ncorner.\\n\"Then I shall leave you four to welcome any new guests that come,\" said\\r\\nDorothy; \"for Button-Bright and I must look our very best at Ozma\\'s\\r\\nbanquet.\"\\n\"Who is still to come?\" asked the Scarecrow.\\n\"Well, there\\'s King Kika-bray of Dunkiton, and Johnny Dooit, and the\\r\\nGood Witch of the North. But Johnny Dooit may not get here until late,\\r\\nhe\\'s so very busy.\"\\n\"We will receive them and give them a proper welcome,\" promised the\\r\\nScarecrow. \"So run along, little Dorothy, and get yourself dressed.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nI WISH I could tell you how fine the company was that assembled that\\r\\nevening at Ozma\\'s royal banquet. A long table was spread in the center\\r\\nof the great dining-hall of the palace and the splendor of the\\r\\ndecorations and the blaze of lights and jewels was acknowledged to be\\r\\nthe most magnificent sight that any of the guests had ever seen.\\nThe jolliest person present, as well as the most important, was of\\r\\ncourse, old Santa Claus; so he was given the seat of honor at one end of\\r\\nthe table while at the other end sat Princess Ozma, the hostess.\\nJohn Dough, Queen Zixi, King Bud, the Queen of Ev and her son Evardo,\\r\\nand the Queen of Merryland had golden thrones to sit in, while the\\r\\nothers were supplied with beautiful chairs.\\n\\nAt the upper end of the banquet room was a separate table provided for\\r\\nthe animals. Toto sat at one end of this table, with a bib tied around\\r\\nhis neck and a silver platter to eat from. At the other end was placed a\\r\\nsmall stand, with a low rail around the edge of it, for Billina and her\\r\\nchicks. The rail kept the ten little Dorothys from falling off the\\r\\nstand, while the Yellow Hen could easily reach over and take her food\\r\\nfrom her tray upon the table. At other places sat the Hungry Tiger, the\\r\\nCowardly Lion, the Saw-Horse, the Rubber Bear, the Fox King and the\\r\\nDonkey King; they made quite a company of animals.\\nAt the lower end of the great room was another table, at which sat the\\r\\nRyls and Knooks who had come with Santa Claus, the wooden soldiers who\\r\\nhad come with the Queen of Merryland, and the Hilanders and Lolanders\\r\\nwho had come with John Dough. Here were also seated the officers of the\\r\\nroyal palace and of Ozma\\'s army.\\nThe splendid costumes of those at the three tables made a gorgeous and\\r\\nglittering display that no one present was ever likely to forget;\\r\\nperhaps there has never been in any part of the world at any time\\r\\nanother assemblage of such wonderful people as that which gathered this\\r\\nevening to honor the birthday of the Ruler of Oz.\\nWhen all the members of the company were in their places an orchestra of\\r\\nfive hundred pieces, in a balcony overlooking the banquet room, began to\\r\\nplay sweet and delightful music. Then a door draped with royal green\\r\\nopened, and in came the fair and girlish Princess Ozma, who now greeted\\r\\nher guests in person for the first time.\\nAs she stood by her throne at the head of the banquet table every eye\\r\\nwas turned eagerly upon the lovely Princess, who was as dignified as she\\r\\nwas bewitching, and who smiled upon all her old and new friends in a\\r\\nway that touched their hearts and brought an answering smile to every\\r\\nface.\\nEach guest had been served with a crystal goblet filled with lacasa,\\r\\nwhich is a sort of nectar famous in Oz and nicer to drink than\\r\\nsoda-water or lemonade. Santa now made a pretty speech in verse,\\r\\ncongratulating Ozma on having a birthday, and asking every one present\\r\\nto drink to the health and happiness of their dearly beloved hostess.\\r\\nThis was done with great enthusiasm by those who were made so they could\\r\\ndrink at all, and those who could not drink politely touched the rims of\\r\\ntheir goblets to their lips. All seated themselves at the tables and the\\r\\nservants of the Princess began serving the feast.\\nI am quite sure that only in Fairyland could such a delicious repast be\\r\\nprepared. The dishes were of precious metals set with brilliant jewels\\r\\nand the good things to eat which were placed upon them were countless in\\r\\nnumber and of exquisite flavor. Several present, such as the Candy Man,\\r\\nthe Rubber Bear, Tik-tok, and the Scarecrow, were not made so they could\\r\\neat, and the Queen of Merryland contented herself with a small dish of\\r\\nsawdust; but these enjoyed the pomp and glitter of the gorgeous scene as\\r\\nmuch as did those who feasted.\\nDRINKING THE HEALTH OF PRINCESS OZMA OF OZ\\nThe Woggle-Bug read his \"Ode to Ozma,\" which was written in very good\\r\\nrhythm and was well received by the company. The Wizard added to the\\r\\nentertainment by making a big pie appear before Dorothy, and when the\\r\\nlittle girl cut the pie the nine tiny piglets leaped out of it and\\r\\ndanced around the table, while the orchestra played a merry tune. This\\r\\namused the company very much, but they were even more pleased when\\r\\nPolychrome, whose hunger had been easily satisfied, rose from the table\\r\\nand performed her graceful and bewildering Rainbow Dance for them. When\\r\\nit was ended the people clapped their hands and the animals clapped\\r\\ntheir paws, while Billina cackled and the Donkey King brayed approval.\\nJohnny Dooit was present, and of course he proved he could do wonders in\\r\\nthe way of eating, as well as in everything else that he undertook to\\r\\ndo; the Tin Woodman sang a love song, every one joining in the chorus;\\r\\nand the wooden soldiers from Merryland gave an exhibition of a lightning\\r\\ndrill with their wooden muskets; the Ryls and Knooks danced the Fairy\\r\\nCircle; and the Rubber Bear bounced himself all around the room. There\\r\\nwas laughter and merriment on every side, and everybody was having a\\r\\nroyal good time. Button-Bright was so excited and interested that he\\r\\npaid little attention to his fine dinner and a great deal of attention\\r\\nto his queer companions; and perhaps he was wise to do this, because he\\r\\ncould eat at any other time.\\nThe feasting and merrymaking continued until late in the evening, when\\r\\nthey separated to meet again the next morning and take part in the\\r\\nbirthday celebration, to which this royal banquet was merely the\\r\\nintroduction.\\n\\n\\n\\nA CLEAR, perfect day, with a gentle breeze and a sunny sky, greeted\\r\\nPrincess Ozma as she wakened next morning, the anniversary of her birth.\\r\\nWhile it was yet early all the city was astir and crowds of people came\\r\\nfrom all parts of the Land of Oz to witness the festivities in honor of\\r\\ntheir girl Ruler\\'s birthday.\\nThe noted visitors from foreign countries, who had all been transported\\r\\nto the Emerald City by means of the Magic Belt, were as much a show to\\r\\nthe Ozites as were their own familiar celebrities, and the streets\\r\\nleading from the royal palace to the jeweled gates were thronged with\\r\\nmen, women, and children to see the procession as it passed out to the\\r\\ngreen fields where the ceremonies were to take place.\\nAnd what a great procession it was!\\nFirst came a thousand young girls—the prettiest in the land—dressed in\\r\\nwhite muslin, with green sashes and hair ribbons, bearing great baskets\\r\\nof red roses. As they walked they scattered these flowers upon the\\r\\nmarble pavements, so that the way was carpeted thick with roses for the\\r\\nprocession to walk upon.\\nThen came the Rulers of the four Kingdoms of Oz; the Emperor of the\\r\\nWinkies, the Monarch of the Munchkins, the King of the Quadlings and the\\r\\nSovereign of the Gillikins, each wearing a long chain of emeralds around\\r\\nhis neck to show that he was a vassal of the Ruler of the Emerald City.\\nNext marched the Emerald City Cornet Band, clothed in green-and-gold\\r\\nuniforms and playing the \"Ozma Two-Step.\" The Royal Army of Oz followed,\\r\\nconsisting of twenty-seven officers, from the Captain-General down to\\r\\nthe Lieutenants. There were no privates in Ozma\\'s Army because soldiers\\r\\nwere not needed to fight battles, but only to look important, and an\\r\\nofficer always looks more imposing than a private.\\nWhile the people cheered and waved their hats and handkerchiefs, there\\r\\ncame walking the Royal Princess Ozma, looking so pretty and sweet that\\r\\nit is no wonder her people love her so dearly. She had decided she\\r\\nwould not ride in her chariot that day, as she preferred to walk in the\\r\\nprocession with her favored subjects and her guests. Just in front of\\r\\nher trotted the living Blue Bear Rug owned by old Dyna, which wobbled\\r\\nclumsily on its four feet because there was nothing but the skin to\\r\\nsupport them, with a stuffed head at one end and a stubby tail at the\\r\\nother. But whenever Ozma paused in her walk the Bear Rug would flop down\\r\\nflat upon the ground for the princess to stand upon until she resumed\\r\\nher progress.\\nFollowing the Princess stalked her two enormous beasts, the Cowardly\\r\\nLion and the Hungry Tiger, and even if the Army had not been there these\\r\\ntwo would have been powerful enough to guard their mistress from any\\r\\nharm.\\nNext marched the invited guests, who were loudly cheered by the people\\r\\nof Oz along the road, and were therefore obliged to bow to right and\\r\\nleft almost every step of the way. First was Santa Claus, who, because\\r\\nhe was fat and not used to walking, rode the wonderful Saw-Horse. The\\r\\nmerry old gentleman had a basket of small toys with him, and he tossed\\r\\nthe toys one by one to the children as he passed by. His Ryls and Knooks\\r\\nmarched close behind him.\\nQueen Zixi of Ix came after; then John Dough and the Cherub, with the\\r\\nrubber bear named Para Bruin strutting between them on its hind legs;\\r\\nthen the Queen of Merryland, escorted by her wooden soldiers; then King\\r\\nBud of Noland and his sister, the Princess Fluff; then the Queen of Ev\\r\\nand her ten royal children; then the Braided Man and the Candy Man, side\\r\\nby side; then King Dox of Foxville and King Kik-a-bray of Dunkiton, who\\r\\nby this time had become good friends; and finally Johnny Dooit, in his\\r\\nleather apron, smoking his long pipe.\\n\\nThese wonderful personages were not more heartily cheered by the people\\r\\nthan were those who followed after them in the procession. Dorothy was a\\r\\ngeneral favorite, and she walked arm in arm with the Scarecrow, who was\\r\\nbeloved by all. Then came Polychrome and Button-Bright, and the people\\r\\nloved the Rainbow\\'s pretty Daughter and the beautiful blue-eyed boy as\\r\\nsoon as they saw them. The shaggy man in his shaggy new suit attracted\\r\\nmuch attention because he was such a novelty. With regular steps tramped\\r\\nthe machine-man Tik-tok, and there was more cheering when the Wizard of\\r\\nOz followed in the procession. The Woggle-Bug and Jack Pumpkinhead were\\r\\nnext, and behind them Glinda the Sorceress and the Good Witch of the\\r\\nNorth. Finally came Billina, with her brood of chickens to whom she\\r\\nclucked anxiously to keep them together and to hasten them along so they\\r\\nwould not delay the procession.\\nAnother band followed, this time the Tin Band of the Emperor of the\\r\\nWinkies, playing a beautiful march called, \"There\\'s No Plate like Tin.\"\\r\\nThen came the servants of the Royal Palace, in a long line, and behind\\r\\nthem all the people joined the procession and marched away through the\\r\\nemerald gates and out upon the broad green.\\nHere had been erected a splendid pavilion, with a grandstand big enough\\r\\nto seat all the royal party and those who had taken part in the\\r\\nprocession. Over the pavilion, which was of green silk and cloth of\\r\\ngold, countless banners waved in the breeze. Just in front of this, and\\r\\nconnected with it by a runway, had been built a broad platform, so that\\r\\nall the spectators could see plainly the entertainment provided for\\r\\nthem.\\nThe Wizard now became Master of Ceremonies, as Ozma had placed the\\r\\nconduct of the performance in his hands. After the people had all\\r\\ncongregated about the platform and the royal party and the visitors were\\r\\nseated in the grandstand, the Wizard skillfully performed some feats of\\r\\njuggling glass balls and lighted candles. He tossed a dozen or so of\\r\\nthem high in the air and caught them one by one as they came down,\\r\\nwithout missing any.\\nThen he introduced the Scarecrow, who did a sword-swallowing act that\\r\\naroused much interest. After this the Tin Woodman gave an exhibition of\\r\\nSwinging the Axe, which he made to whirl around him so rapidly that the\\r\\neye could scarcely follow the motion of the gleaming blade. Glinda the\\r\\nSorceress then stepped upon the platform, and by her magic made a big\\r\\ntree grow in the middle of the space, made blossoms appear upon the\\r\\ntree, and made the blossoms become delicious fruit called tamornas; and\\r\\nso great was the quantity of fruit thus produced that when the servants\\r\\nclimbed the tree and tossed it down to the crowd, there was enough to\\r\\nsatisfy every person present.\\nPara Bruin, the rubber bear, climbed to a limb of the big tree, rolled\\r\\nhimself into a ball, and dropped to the platform, whence he bounded up\\r\\nagain to the limb. He repeated this bouncing act several times, to the\\r\\ngreat delight of all the children present. After he had finished, and\\r\\nbowed, and returned to his seat, Glinda waved her wand and the tree\\r\\ndisappeared; but its fruit still remained to be eaten.\\nThe Good Witch of the North amused the people by transforming ten stones\\r\\ninto ten birds, the ten birds into ten lambs, and the ten lambs into ten\\r\\nlittle girls, who gave a pretty dance and were then transformed into ten\\r\\nstones again, just as they were in the beginning.\\nJohnny Dooit next came on the platform with his tool-chest, and in a few\\r\\nminutes built a great flying machine; then put his chest in the machine\\r\\nand the whole thing flew away together—Johnny and all—after he had bid\\r\\ngood-bye to those present and thanked the Princess for her hospitality.\\n\\nThe Wizard then announced the last act of all, which was considered\\r\\nreally wonderful. He had invented a machine to blow huge soap-bubbles,\\r\\nas big as balloons, and this machine was hidden under the platform so\\r\\nthat only the rim of the big clay pipe to produce the bubbles showed\\r\\nabove the flooring. The tank of soap-suds, and the air-pumps to inflate\\r\\nthe bubbles, were out of sight beneath, so that when the bubbles began\\r\\nto grow upon the floor of the platform it really seemed like magic to\\r\\nthe people of Oz, who knew nothing about even the common soap-bubbles\\r\\nthat our children blow with a penny clay pipe and a basin of\\r\\nsoap-and-water.\\nThe Wizard had invented another thing. Usually soap-bubbles are frail\\r\\nand burst easily, lasting only a few moments as they float in the air;\\r\\nbut the Wizard added a sort of glue to his soapsuds, which made his\\r\\nbubbles tough; and, as the glue dried rapidly when exposed to the air,\\r\\nthe Wizard\\'s bubbles were strong enough to float for hours without\\r\\nbreaking.\\nHe began by blowing—by means of his machinery and air-pumps—several\\r\\nlarge bubbles which he allowed to float upward into the sky, where the\\r\\nsunshine fell upon them and gave them iridescent hues that were most\\r\\nbeautiful. This aroused much wonder and delight, because it was a new\\r\\namusement to every one present—except perhaps Dorothy and\\r\\nButton-Bright, and even they had never seen such big, strong bubbles\\r\\nbefore.\\nTHE WIZARD BLEW A BUBBLE AROUND SANTA CLAUS\\nThe Wizard then blew a bunch of small bubbles and afterward blew a big\\r\\nbubble around them so they were left in the center of it; then he\\r\\nallowed the whole mass of pretty globes to float into the air and\\r\\ndisappear in the far distant sky.\\n\"That is really fine!\" declared Santa Claus, who loved toys and pretty\\r\\nthings. \"I think, Mr. Wizard, I shall have you blow a bubble around me;\\r\\nthen I can float away home and see the country spread out beneath me as\\r\\nI travel. There isn\\'t a spot on earth that I haven\\'t visited, but I\\r\\nusually go in the night-time, riding behind my swift reindeer. Here is a\\r\\ngood chance to observe the country by daylight, while I am riding slowly\\r\\nand at my ease.\"\\n\"Do you think you will be able to guide the bubble?\" asked the Wizard.\\n\"Oh yes; I know enough magic to do that,\" replied Santa Claus. \"You blow\\r\\nthe bubble, with me inside of it, and I\\'ll be sure to get home in\\r\\nsafety.\"\\n\"Please send me home in a bubble, too!\" begged the Queen of Merryland.\\n\"Very well, madam; you shall try the journey first,\" politely answered\\r\\nold Santa.\\nThe pretty wax doll bade good-bye to the Princess Ozma and the others,\\r\\nand stood on the platform while the Wizard blew a big soap-bubble around\\r\\nher. When completed he allowed the bubble to float slowly upward, and\\r\\nthere could be seen the little Queen of Merryland standing in the\\r\\nmiddle of it and blowing kisses from her fingers to those below. The\\r\\nbubble took a southerly direction, quickly floating out of sight.\\n\"That\\'s a very nice way to travel,\" said Princess Fluff. \"I\\'d like to go\\r\\nhome in a bubble, too.\"\\nSo the Wizard blew a big bubble around Princess Fluff, and another\\r\\naround King Bud, her brother, and a third one around Queen Zixi; and\\r\\nsoon these three bubbles had mounted into the sky and were floating off\\r\\nin a group in the direction of the kingdom of Noland.\\nThe success of these ventures induced the other guests from foreign\\r\\nlands to undertake bubble journeys, also; so the Wizard put them one by\\r\\none inside his bubbles, and Santa Claus directed the way they should go,\\r\\nbecause he knew exactly where everybody lived.\\nFinally Button-Bright said:\\n\"I want to go home, too.\"\\n\"Why, so you shall!\" cried Santa; \"for I\\'m sure your father and mother\\r\\nwill be glad to see you again. Mr. Wizard, please blow a big, fine\\r\\nbubble for Button-Bright to ride in, and I\\'ll agree to send him home to\\r\\nhis family as safe as safe can be.\"\\n\"I\\'m sorry,\" said Dorothy with a sigh, for she was fond of her little\\r\\ncomrade; \"but p\\'raps it\\'s best for Button-Bright to get home; \\'cause\\r\\nhis folks must be worrying just dreadful.\"\\nShe kissed the boy, and Ozma kissed him, too, and all the others waved\\r\\ntheir hands and said good-bye and wished him a pleasant journey.\\n\"Are you glad to leave us, dear?\" asked Dorothy, a little wistfully.\\n\"Don\\'t know,\" said Button-Bright.\\nHe sat down cross-legged on the platform, with his sailor hat tipped\\r\\nback on his head, and the Wizard blew a beautiful bubble all around him.\\nA minute later it had mounted into the sky, sailing toward the west, and\\r\\nthe last they saw of Button-Bright he was still sitting in the middle of\\r\\nthe shining globe and waving his sailor-hat at those below.\\n\"Will you ride in a bubble, or shall I send you and Toto home by means\\r\\nof the Magic Belt?\" the Princess asked Dorothy.\\n\"Guess I\\'ll use the Belt,\" replied the little girl. \"I\\'m sort of \\'fraid\\r\\nof those bubbles.\"\\n\"Bow-wow!\" said Toto, approvingly. He loved to bark at the bubbles as\\r\\nthey sailed away, but he didn\\'t care to ride in one.\\nSanta Claus decided to go next. He thanked Ozma for her hospitality and\\r\\nwished her many happy returns of the day. Then the Wizard blew a bubble\\r\\naround his chubby little body and smaller bubbles around each of his\\r\\nRyls and Knooks.\\nAs the kind and generous friend of children mounted into the air the\\r\\npeople all cheered at the top of their voices, for they loved Santa\\r\\nClaus dearly; and the little man heard them through the walls of the\\r\\nbubble and waved his hands in return as he smiled down upon them. The\\r\\nband played bravely while every one watched the bubble until it was\\r\\ncompletely out of sight.\\n\"How \\'bout you, Polly?\" Dorothy asked her friend. \"Are you \\'fraid of\\r\\nbubbles, too?\"\\n\"No,\" answered Polychrome, smiling; \"but Santa Claus promised to speak\\r\\nto my father as he passed through the sky. So perhaps I shall get home\\r\\nan easier way.\"\\nIndeed, the little maid had scarcely made this speech when a sudden\\r\\nradiance filled the air, and while the people looked on in wonder the\\r\\nend of a gorgeous rainbow slowly settled down upon the platform.\\nWith a glad cry the Rainbow\\'s Daughter sprang from her seat and danced\\r\\nalong the curve of the bow, mounting gradually upward, while the folds\\r\\nof her gauzy gown whirled and floated around her like a cloud and\\r\\nblended with the colors of the rainbow itself.\\n\"GOOD-BYE, OZMA! GOOD-BYE, DOROTHY!\"\\n\"Good-bye, Ozma! Good-bye, Dorothy!\" cried a voice they knew belonged\\r\\nto Polychrome; but now the little maiden\\'s form had melted wholly into\\r\\nthe rainbow, and their eyes could no longer see her.\\nSuddenly the end of the rainbow lifted and its colors slowly faded like\\r\\nmist before a breeze. Dorothy sighed deeply and turned to Ozma.\\n\"I\\'m sorry to lose Polly,\" she said; \"but I guess she\\'s better off with\\r\\nher father; \\'cause even the Land of Oz couldn\\'t be like home to a cloud\\r\\nfairy.\"\\n\"No, indeed,\" replied the Princess; \"but it has been delightful for us\\r\\nto know Polychrome for a little while, and—who knows?—perhaps we may\\r\\nmeet the Rainbow\\'s daughter again, some day.\"\\nThe entertainment being now ended, all left the pavilion and formed\\r\\ntheir gay procession back to the Emerald City again. Of Dorothy\\'s recent\\r\\ntraveling companions only Toto and the shaggy man remained, and Ozma had\\r\\ndecided to allow the latter to live in Oz for a time, at least. If he\\r\\nproved honest and true she promised to let him live there always, and\\r\\nthe shaggy man was anxious to earn this reward.\\nThey had a nice quiet dinner together and passed a pleasant evening with\\r\\nthe Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, Tik-tok, and the Yellow Hen for company.\\nWhen Dorothy bade them good-night she kissed them all good-bye at the\\r\\nsame time. For Ozma had agreed that while Dorothy slept she and Toto\\r\\nshould be transported by means of the Magic Belt to her own little bed\\r\\nin the Kansas farmhouse and the little girl laughed as she thought how\\r\\nastonished Uncle Henry and Aunt Em would be when she came down to\\r\\nbreakfast with them next morning.\\nQuite content to have had so pleasant an adventure, and a little tired\\r\\nby all the day\\'s busy scenes, Dorothy clasped Toto in her arms and lay\\r\\ndown upon the pretty white bed in her room in Ozma\\'s royal palace.\\nPresently she was sound asleep.\\nTHE END\\n\\nTHE TWINKLE TALES\\nBy Laura Bancroft\\nEach volume, 5 x 7 inches, with 16 full pages in colors, and other\\r\\nillustrations by Maginel Wright Enright\\nPRINCE MUD TURTLE\\nIn this story Twinkle, a little girl, captures a mud turtle who turns\\r\\nout to be a fairy prince.\\nMR.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\\r\\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\\r\\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\\r\\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\\r\\npeople in all walks of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\\r\\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\\'s\\r\\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\\r\\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\\r\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\r\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\r\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\r\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\r\\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\r\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\r\\n\\r\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\r\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\r\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\r\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\r\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\r\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\r\\nstatus with the IRS.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\r\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\r\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\r\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\r\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\r\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\r\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\r\\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\r\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\r\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\r\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\r\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\r\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\r\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\r\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\r\\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\r\\nworks.\\r\\n\\r\\nProfessor Michael S.
